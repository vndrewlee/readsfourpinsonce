   do you guys miss kanye's old blog as much as i do? it was way better than most celebrity blogs, though that's not saying much, for a multitude of reasons, chief amongst them being that he actually shared things he was into rather than simply putting on brands that were paying him to do so (shouts to his baby moms for eating off that though). he took the time to dispel celebrity gossip and get weirdly (read: brilliantly) personal at unexpected times, keeping daily readers like myself borderline thirsty for more. for many modern-day internet hustlers, kanyeuniversecity.com/blog was some type of education on the best of the best in fashion, streetwear, shoes, music, film and crazy ass woodland architecture. its departure was somewhat painful our digital alma mater had officially closed its doors forever. yet the blog wasn't just an educational tool for aspiring culture writers. its value as an online representation of kanye's perpetual knack for trend forecasting becomes extremely evident by looking deep into his archives. he championed styles, artists and behaviors that, while commonplace today, were seldom heard of an internet lifetime ago. of course, that's not to say kanye was always some sort of modern day blogstradmus. he put on tons of things that never really made it into the pop culture landscape or even off of his own website. but at the end of the day, whether or not his blog was always correct in forecasting trends does not detract from its significance as a portal into the mind of one of today's most polarizing and complicated celebrities. left picture of

instagram, but the content of every single one of those photos is 100% fake. not because she's some russian stripper that always shows up in my tinder matches, but because for the past six months or so, she created a manufactured life that was, for her, a personal art project. vulture spoke to amalia about the lengths she was willing to go to make this a reality. the core component? a perfectly internet character and storyline: the provincial girl moves to the big city, wants to be a model, wants money, splits up with her high-school boyfriend, wants to change her lifestyle, enjoys singledom, runs out of money because she doesn t have a job, because she is too self-absorbed in her narcissism, she starts going on seeking-arrangement dates, gets a sugar daddy, gets depressed, starts doing more drugs, gets a boob job because her sugar daddy makes her feel insecure about her body, and also he pays for it, she goes through a breakdown, redemption takes place, the crazy bitch apologizes, the dumb blonde turns brunette and goes back home. probably goes to rehab, then she is grounded at her family house. if that's a storyline you're all too familiar with and seen play out on facebook countless times courtesy of the girls you went to high school with, that's because amalia researched the types of girls who have become popular on instagram or tumblr and combined their personalities with photography to portray it as accurately as possible. for example, posting inspirational quotes or certain makeup and hair styles to maximize impact. she also used trending hashtags to up her follower and like count and even went as far as to get a boob job, though there is some speculation that the plastic surgery was faked. either way, that's some fucking unbelievable, next level commitment to art. by the end of the campaign, some people had caught on, but the general sham still remained largely unnoticed. guys, i am so fucking in on this. totally support it. love it. tell me more, amalia, please. this only shows how bullshit the most popular instagram accounts are, as if today's platform-wide humbling wasn't proof of that already. amalia points out that social media should really be about spontaneity, but so many people manufacture and fabricate details just to get attention. personally, i also can't stand people posting photos on instagram that they took on their actual cameras. shit's just not fair. but that's an argument for another time. for now, just revel in the thirstiness of strangers on the internet and one girl willing to get a new set of tits for the sake of art.         i get a text from drake at 12:34 am.  where you at? come to my crib.  the boy as much of his team refers to him is having a party tonight. the guard at the entrance to his gated hidden hills neighborhood tells me that drake has reached his limit on guests for the evening. even with an invite, access to drake s home requires effort.  fuckkk. man, i m coming for you.  seconds later, a black, heavily-tinted escalade arrives at the gate. the driver rolls down the window and calls out my name. the suv makes it to drake s estate and pulls into the driveway. i see a basketball court, foreign cars sitting in a garage and a crowd of women standing by a side door, waiting to check their phones with security. i get out and prepare to do the same when a member of security calls out my name, escorts me to the front of the line and into the house. i walk up a single flight of stairs to the kitchen. the aesthetic inside is warm earth tones, with lots of wood. the lighting has a neon glow that makes reds look orange and blues look purple. there s drake, posted up against a nook in the corner of the kitchen. he s wearing an all red ovo sweatsuit with gold owl embroidery. individuals famous for their own work within or association with this operation 40, chubbs, ob o brien, ryan are in the vicinity. drake greets me like he s known me for a decade. it s a casual weekday night, but the spread on the counter adjacent looks like the catering at a fortune 500 company s holiday party. raekwon is sitting at the island that holds all of this food. he s rolling a blunt. when drake is surrounded by friends, the vibe is a bit like the  funny guy  scene in goodfellas. rambunctious laughter is intermittent. drake might rap,  i haven t had a good time in a long time,  but you wouldn t know that from looking at him tonight. he offers me a drink and we make our way into the next room, across it and to the bar. the energy of the space follows drake. he is the energy. bystanders are visibly thrilled when he walks past. his presence is always noted. his needs are always tended to. this night really puts  i use a walkie-talkie just to get a beverage  into perspective. drake is the boss. we saunter behind the bar and talk for a while 20 minutes or so. this feels like an eternity in drake world, where seldom a moment passes that someone doesn t try to get his attention. there s business to discuss. there are people to meet. there are women lingering nearby who jump in to introduce themselves whenever they sense a lull in the conversation, but there aren t many. i m downing jack daniel s on the rocks. drake is drinking beer. i think it s a lagunitas ipa, but i can t be certain. the point is, he s keeping it chill. we re not guzzling from vintage bottles of dom, though several of those line one of the shelves at his bar.  if kanye wasn t in armenia, he d be here right now. he comes by all the time. he just bought a house, like, five houses down from me.  the last time i was at coachella, i saw kanye. four years ago. it s the stuff of legend by now. yeezy wore a c line women s blouse, absolutely destroyed the festival and gave one of the best performances of his career. the pressure is on drake to do exactly that this weekend, since he currently occupies the number one spot that kanye did in 2011. his own headlining coachella gig is in four days. everyone expects a career-defining set. i ve been watching nirvana s reading 1992 performance a lot lately. it s the one where kurt comes out in a wheelchair, wearing a hospital gown and bodies everything. drake is a fan of the performance too. i tell him that this coachella set has to be equally transcendent. what s his 2pac hologram going to be?  we re bringing out madonna.  his excitement is palpable. he sort of half-punches the air with confidence when revealing the news. i m one of twelve people who still likes madonna, so it sounds like a great idea to me. admittedly, the weekend 2 surprise that he shares sounds much better. spending time at drake s residence feels how i imagine spending time at neverland ranch felt in 1991. like michael jackson that year, drake is working on his eighth musical project, views from the 6. if the implicit paranoia of his most recent opus, if you re reading this it s too late, is any indication, drake knows that this is a crucial juncture in his career. he s reached the level of fame when the audience s enthusiasm can lead to fatigue. for drake to avoid backlash, his next album must mark a departure from the sound that's brought him worldwide acclaim. it s similar to what jackson did by embracing hip-hop and new jack swing on dangerous. this is a fact drake acknowledges on too late's no tellin, rapping, i had to switch the flow up on you niggas, shit was getting too predictable. the topic of our talk switches to drake s upcoming fourth album. he only has two songs finished that he likes. one is a collaboration with beyonc  that he recorded a while ago. the other is a song that he expects to inspire a paradigm shift. his days of releasing lay-up bangers that everyone loves right away are over. for now. views from the 6 needs to shock listeners just as much as it needs to impress them. i compare it to what kanye did on his own fourth album, 808s & heartbreak. drake agrees and, as if to reinforce that notion, he tells me that boi-1da said he needs to listen to the non-beyonc  song a few more times before he can decide whether it s good or not. it appears that drake is ready to deviate from his winning formula and get a little weird. the rest of the night is a blur. we talk about the jungle tour. we talk about not calling our mothers often enough. at some point, i stand on his grand piano to rap the first verse of  energy.  winnie harlow approves. security does not. drake has impossibly high expectations to meet at coachella in a few days, and with his next album in the months after that, but i don t sense any trepidation on his part. massive speakers fill the house with a steady stream of future and rae sremmurd, next to practically every song from if you re reading this it s too late and some unreleased drake records. observing an artist while their own song is playing is fascinating. at times, he raps along like there s a fire burning inside of him. other times, he seems oblivious. i m looking at drake the person while simultaneously listening to drake the rapper. as notoriously honest as he is in his music, it s difficult to tell where one ends and the other begins, if there s any distinction between those two personas at all. this, more than anything else, is what makes drake the most thoroughly modern of all rappers. he is the manifestation of the dilemma of the person you present to the world, and the person you are at home, or in your head. the guy who walks around politely checking on everyone at his party is the same one who can t wait to let his new beretta go. soon enough, it s 5 am. i have to go create content for a multi-billion dollar tech company in culver city in a few hours. after work, i stop by the ovo pop-up in the undefeated space on la brea and get a hat. drake s in indio doing his coachella soundcheck. later that night, i send a text telling him to check out  broke boi  by playboi carti, then i pass out on a couch.  coachella is the finesse olympics, and the artist wristband is its gold medal. without one, you re forced to mingle with neon basic bros. with one, the world is yours. i m on the road to indio early this friday morning to claim mine. my friend who s driving is on the same mission. he secured an artist wristband last night by direct messaging lil b. i have a general admission wristband that i got for free at sxsw, but i anticipate charming a will call employee into giving me an artist wristband like i did the last time i was here. drake says he'll get me one, but i don t feel like calling in that favor just yet. i quickly find out just how much coachella s increasingly high profile has hindered the finesse. without my name on any list, my attempt at charming festival employees is a failure and i watch with envy as my friend gleefully tightens the cornflower blue artist pass around his wrist. i immediately fall into a pit of depression. it isn t my character to put so much stock into this type of faux important nonsense. i prefer to be with the masses at 99% of shows, but backstage coachella fomo is the worst kind of fomo. if the opportunity to cross paths with kendall jenner is within reach, i d like to capitalize on it. to combat this disappointment, i pop a pill that a new york friend gave me earlier that morning when i dropped off my bags at the crash pad that i'm staying at this weekend. i try to remain optimistic. perhaps i'll just be the anti-exclusive rebel who swags out ga. by the time i get into the festival, i have zero reservations about not having an artist pass. i m rolling face, the euphoria of all the patrons is contagious and i m immediately watching excellent sets from vic mensa, action bronson, azealia banks and, best of all, lil b. moshing to  like a martian  with a thousand eager teens is worth the price of admission alone. like the great prophet ja rule once said, let's get the party crackin  right here; fuck vip.  this enthusiasm fades once the mdma wears off and enough people hit me up asking if i'm backstage. i have to finesse, so i swallow my pride and the drake text goes out: everyone i know has an artist pass. i'm stranded in ga like a bum. any way your people can put me down. he responds promptly: yeah full name on id an hour later, i'm back at will call and the artist pass is mine. finesseeeeeerrr. i slide it onto my wrist with glory. the squad i'm rolling with has theirs. glo up and its derivatives are used incessantly. we go to this beautiful desert crib that chance, the rapper's manager, pat, is staying at and drink a few beers while blasting music. the term  it s lit  is overused. back at the festival, i run into ezra koenig and alana haim on the vip lawn during ac/dc. the fourth vampire weekend record is coming, so ezra relates to the dilemma drake is facing with views from the 6. we ve spoken about it before. to be honest, i stole the michael jackson analogy from ezra. he brought it up at dinner in nyc several months ago. (which, by the way, doesn't it seem like dangerous is mj's fourth album? i don t feel like his solo career really starts until off the wall. it's kind of like the debate about whether good kid, m.a.a.d city is kendrick lamar's first album, or his third.) we make more small talk about fourth albums and drake, then i say something embarrassing about taylor swift to alana before waltzing over to alesso's set. the edm scene is alive and well. this swedish motherfucker has the sahara tent turnt. day one of coachella is a wrap. i sneak onto a shuttle bus with aforementioned new york friend on my way out. me and her squad smoke a joint in their hot tub when we get back to the crib. everyone drifts off to bed.  the next morning, i take a bunch of shrooms before noon and hop in an uber. there aren't many acts that i want to or need to see until later, so i post up on a couch in the artist lounge area. i mooch weed from 50-year-old rock dads. i trip balls. i charge my phone. like every great mushroom trip, there's a moment of agonizing stomach pain where i overanalyze the fact that i'm poisoning myself for leisure, but it passes and i head off to see some live music. i watch hozier from side stage. i lose my mind at run the jewels and kick myself for sleeping on them. i meet up with old college friends and mob out at the do lab. i meet up with current new york friends and mob out at tyler, the creator. i have vague plans to meet drake at the weeknd, but i'm high, with friends and i don't feel like wearing out my welcome and texting this dude every five minutes, so it doesn't happen. i check out axwell ^ ingrosso and, as i m leaving, i have one of those moments that makes artist passes worth the thousands for which scalpers are able to sell them. i pass a woman in an ankle-length, powder blue coat. she's wearing sunglasses, smoking a blunt and her specter is intoxicating. i perform a very thirsty 180-degree turn when i realize that it's rihanna. i walk up and tap her from behind: yo, you're a goddess. she assesses my general desperateness with one glance, silently ashes her blunt on the palm tree between us, turns back around and walks off without saying a word. i m scheming on my next move. some homies text me about a dinner with drake. they slide the address. i have a plan. uber and cab lines are insane. by the time i get in either, the dinner party will be over. here's another situation i have to finesse. i walk at least a mile up the road outside the festival looking for stray cabs while trying to order an uber. neither method is effective, but i spot a papa john's delivery guy driving out of a gated community and wave him down. he's down to whip me over to the restaurant drake's at for some extra money. the place is called the nest. escalades and security line the entrance. it's well after midnight, but ovo has clearly taken over the establishment for an after-hours, tell 'em i'ma need reservations for 20 type of setting. thankfully, security remembers me from the other night. i don't even see drake at first. my homies are aux cord djing and i ask them to play broke boi. i've met oliver, one of the masterminds behind ovo, several times and we catch up for a minute. then someone gets my attention and points over to drake. he motions for me to come over. i pull up a seat next to him, ob, ryan and a woman who shall remain nameless. the first thing i ask drake is what he thinks of  broke boi.   it s hard.  considering that his coachella performance is less than 24 hours away, i follow-up with, are you ready? he asks me the same. i let him know that i'd like to run on-stage and wild out for know yourself if that's an option, just like dancing tony did during nirvana's reading gig. i will literally dedicate a portion of ovo fest to dancing ernest. i'm holding him to that. tyler, the creator actually gave me waves of nirvana at his set a few hours ago when he intentionally goofed parts of yonkers just like kurt did with smells like teen spirit at reading, and many other gigs. i don't know why i'm fixated on the nirvana thing. i guess i just genuinely want drake to have a moment on that level. coachella is a big deal. it's an opportunity to make history. and that's cooler than seeing someone fuck up. i've seen incredible drake concerts before. would you like a tour? last year s ovo fest. drake vs. wayne. i've seen him perform an underwhelming set too. i tell him how, after summer jam 2010, i thought he was a better recording artist than performer. that s changed. five years later, he s just as good on stage as he is in headphones. i ask drake why he isn't streaming the performance. he's going to now. it will be announced tomorrow. i won't go into the details, but essentially, he wasn't getting his way over something with the festival organizers, so he held out and from the expression on his face it s evident that this victory brings him immense satisfaction. drake asks me if they ve announced the jungle tour yet. they haven t. i realize how insulated he can be from minor details like the timing of tour announcements. the boss doesn t know what s happening minute-to-minute with every racket. he just calls the shots and collects the money. i tell him that i plan on writing about my experiences around him this weekend.  that s cool. but you have to do one thing. make sure to mention that i had chicken in my pasta, not italian sausage. i m kidding. i just hope you like the show.  drake s uncle shows up. i never ask if this is the uncle from  look what you ve done,   started from the bottom  and  too much.  instead, i spend the rest of the night loitering outside around p reign, bumming belmont cigarettes off ryan. i haven t had these canadian exclusives since the last time i was in toronto. they re really the best thing i ve ever tasted. it s late. drake is leaving. he takes photos with restaurant staff, shares goodbyes with everyone in the room and gets ready to rest up for one of the most important days of his life. i keep the party going and uber over to this house party jeremy scott is throwing a couple of miles away. the door is stupid, but i walk in like ernest baker and it s fine. diplo and skrillex are djing. i talk to virgil abloh. i see ezra again. i try to bum a cigarette from zoe kravitz, but she doesn t have any left. i run into old friends. i run into new friends. i hear katy perry was here earlier. this is completely useless, but it s awesome. i get home at some ridiculous hour and spend the better part of sunday passed out.  i wake up sporadically throughout the day, mostly when the people i m staying with rally and head out to the festival. all of a sudden, it s 7 pm and i m still in boxers on the couch. last night, drake mentioned the possibility of linking up before the show. in the first attempt to get my life together, i shoot a text to see what he s up to.  i ll see you after the show. i m just in that zone.  i m at coachella by 9 pm. it s fully dark outside. it s a different, more debaucherous festival at night. drake is scheduled to go on at 10:15. i spend the first hour sneaking some friends into the artist viewing area so they can watch drake s set close up. then i ditch them because i d like to at least try going to backstage for drake s set, even though i don t have the special whatever the fuck you need. i spot some more friends on the way over and we stand around with chance, the rapper, vic mensa and their respective entourages, plotting. everyone wants to go backstage, but it almost doesn t seem worth it. i decide to try my luck. my luck has run out. no amount of texts or selfies with drake that i show festival security convinces them that i m supposed to be backstage, but i wait it out and look for an opportunity to finesse because that s what you do in these situations. in the meantime, usher and his people walk in. i see a lot of not-as-famous-as-usher famous people getting denied. i understand why justin bieber had problems at this gate. i push my luck again and mid-argument with security, someone from ovo walks up and shouts,  ernest is good!  and hands me an all-access laminate adorned with if you re reading this it s too late cover art on one side and the 6 god insignia on the other. there s a little pre-party going on in this private area off to the side of the main stage. there s an open bar. there s a lot of celebrities. at one point, drake stands in the doorway of his trailer, surveying the scene, then disappears back inside. security sweeps everyone except for ovo members out to the artist viewing area. the team isn t religious with it, but they form what you could call a prayer circle around drake. drake says some motivational lines about how everyone on the team is so good at what they do. for them, tonight is like any other night they spent preparing for this moment back in toronto. there just happens to be thousands more people watching this time around. drake strolls to the stage like a boxer walking to the ring. chants and cheers come from all directions. at side stage, another small huddle forms and he raps a few lines from  energy  before the opening notes of  legend  ring off and he walks out to resounding applause. now, side stage is closed and most of us are escorted over to some type of extra special vip. to put it into context, i m watching the show next to future, the weeknd, big sean, david guetta, will.i.am and tyler, the creator. there s a lurking suspicion that this isn t going over as well as the past several times i ve seen drake perform, but it s not going poorly by any stretch of the imagination. people are amped, it s just not necessarily the historical moment that everyone wanted it to be. but i still like drake s music. and i m hearing it live. and it s fun. i m not plugged into what my timeline is saying. i m running up and down the aisles rapping  10 bands.   later, at drake s post-coachella bash, the atmosphere is intensely positive. a who s who of the entertainment industry is at the home he s been staying at in indio, congratulating him on the performance, sheltering him from whatever criticisms are permeating thinkpiece drafts at this very moment. something tells me that drake already knows the tone the media is about to take with his coachella debut. maybe he s already caught wind of some hate. we have an interaction at the party where i give him a compliment about the set, but he isn t totally receptive. no matter how many superstars tell drake that he killed it tonight, there s this hesitation in his mannerisms which suggests that he doesn t totally believe that. the tide is slowly turning against drake. every icon gets to this point. the top becomes more of a battle than a party, and for drake to remain firmly supplanted in this coveted position, he will have to fight for it. if he survives, that s what will make him a legend. moments like this when the people get antsy for a regime shift are why i assume drake writes lyrics like,  i need you to take my mind off being in my prime.  shit s stressful. no one gets to enjoy unchallenged supremacy for too long. drake rose to the top because he was the underdog and it was gratifying to see him succeed. now, he s the top dog and for many it would be just as gratifying to see him fall off. i don t want that. being around drake has reinforced that he is a real person, an actual human being more than just a meme for public consumption. maybe i m empathetic because we share similar stories and background. maybe it s because he s a young, ambitious black man. i relate to that. i can t help but to be happy for the guy. yes, i ve seen better drake shows, but this weekend s reality check was a welcomed one. ladies and gentlemen, you have your arc. how will drake redeem himself next weekend? will the world still stop the next time he drops new music? the plot thickens.  three days after coachella, i m at a house party in malibu. it s a celebration hosted by drake s tour manager, jamil. as fate would have it, i cross paths with drake in a crowded corridor. we ve been texting about the performance. going online must be part of his day because he s read some of the takedowns. the consensus is his weekend 2 performance needs to be better.  i took an l for the first time. i just have to reassess what went wrong with my judgment.  but legends don t sweat. drake doesn t have to be more cautious, just more calculated. he hasn t felt the pressure in a little while, but he hasn t wasted any time getting used to it either. this is where drake s story really gets interesting. ernest baker is a writer living in new york. follow him on twitter here.         lebron james turned 30 last week. as we know, 30 is basically the end of anything good for human beings. your muscles and joints start to creak and ache during mundane tasks, your skin sags from your bones like sleeve of wizard and you're lucky if you can keep your penis at half-mast without chemical aid. it s the end. but lebron is a superhuman galactic-class athlete. he'll be one of the best players in the nba for the duration of the decade. sure, he's currently taking a couple weeks off to rest sore knees, but that's a minor concern compared to his one true weakness: his aging hairline. lebron's publicly mocked battle with follicular recession has gone on too long. it's time for a momentum shift. it's time for a fourth quarter comeback. we, the basketball watching community, who have seen him grow up before our eyes and, subsequently, his hairline recede across his dome like a steadily melting glacier, support him in his struggle. it's time to diane lane this life shit and age gracefully. it's time to bruce willis this shit and embrace the baldness with confidence. listen, i'm not tryna be an asshole about hair. i know and respect many men of varying ages who suffer from the bald, warriors against the cruel realities of time and genetics. it's hard, i'm sure. but lebron can do things few humans on the entire planet can even fathom, and he's self-conscious about his hair? dog, i'm speaking directly to my friend lebron now, that's actually charming. it's nice to know you're human after all, but it is also distracting from your triumphs. you don't need to do this, the constant widening and repositioning of your signature headband, the rumors about experimenting with plugs. gross. i don't know anything about hair restoration tactics, but i know letting nature do it's thing is usually the best option. aging without self-consciousness is a genuine modern struggle. lebron is the the first superstar of the social media age, the first to have everything he does ripped apart by a bunch of nerdy white basketball bloggers on twitter. but after all lebron has conquered on the court, i wish he'd embrace the wisdom of old age. he's tasked with leading a ramshackle team of offensive players to a championship. homie doesn't have time to worry about hair. bron, let that shit go. rally your troops for a late-season push and an improbable finals run where you'll eventually lose to whomever wins the west. angelo spagnolo is a writer living in brooklyn. you can follow him on twitter here.         interning at four pins is a pretty good gig. i see a lot of new product first, i dick around with my boss on twitter and i get to sit in a chair all day making terrible jokes about whatever the fuck it is i feel like. it's a good deal for sure. the thing that people seem to not realize is that we re actually doing work over here in the office regardless if it is the bare minimum. we try to make your shitty lives a little bit better while you sit in your cube pulling up excel spreadsheets. that s what we do. people think we re just chilling and chopping it up with rappers and big booty bitches all day when in reality it s just a bunch of dudes sitting in a cubicle our boss tells people is his office trying to sound cool. i m going to give you guys a little insight into what my day-to-day usually entails. sorry about this not being a video segment, we re broke as shit. tell the white dudes who cut our checks to step their fucking benevolence up. 10:30   i roll in to the office and get stopped at the door. i m a piece of shit intern that doesn t have security clearance to get into the building so i get questioned by three security guards at two different checkpoints every fucking day. i can t believe it to be honest. these assholes see me every monday and friday. bros, why do you feel the need to ask me my name and what floor i m going to after i just gave you half of my sandwich last week? fuck you guys. 10:40   i walk in the front door, suck in my gut and puff out my chest to impress all of the fly honies that work in the office. i don t even know why i think i have a chance. these are, like, professional ass women. what the fuck could they ever possibly want with a broke 21-year-old college student that still lives with his mom? 10:41   get to four pins hq just as my boss is leaving to smoke his 3rd cigarette of the day. like, how is that shit even possible? i can t even brush my teeth then drink a glass of orange juice in the morning. the last thing i could possibly think of after my morning rub and tug is to smoke a stick of tar and shit. 11:00   lawrence is back and we settle in for the day. awkward silence ensues. 11:15 - go over to the tres bien website looking for product. moy has literally written about every item on the entire fucking site. this guy is running a monopoly on the product game right now and it's bullshit. 11:30   just did a good 20 minutes of decent work surfing the internet. time for a twitter break. 11:35   awkward silence. 11:43 - my boss finds a new picture of kanye west he s never seen before. he says some shit like,  ah, dude. mad ill  in his raspy white boy voice. he posts it to his tumblr. 12:00   i'm told to  shut the fuck up  because i m always sick and sniffling all of the time like a baby. 12:15   lawrence asks me if i ve found any new product. i give him the  moy has written about everything  excuse to buy some extra time on twitter. 12:30   awkward silence. 12:40   jian stops by looking for lawrence who isn't around. he calls me by my first name for the first time in three months. it's the little victories that count. 12:45 - lawrence straight up denies a product i ask to write about like he's dikembe mutombo. i feel like a piece of shit. 1:00   i finally find a product lawrence says is cool and i m midway through the write up. i ve been doing this for a while now so i have to leave out all of my racist jokes or lawrence gets upset. 1:15   lawrence fires me via twitter for the third time in a week. 1:30   my product review is up and lawrence edits absolutely everything in it. it s not even the product i asked to write about. he basically just threw my shit into the garbage, did his own and put my name on it. uh, thanks, dude, i guess. 1:50   pitch an article idea to my boss right before i step out for lunch. he says he will run it by the senior editor, noah. 2:10   i m already back from lunch. i feel like a terrible intern that does nothing all day so i guilt myself into going to jamba juice so i don't waste any time actually chewing food. 2:13   overhear lawrence pitch my idea. it usually goes like this: lawrence:  yeah, so, james has this idea of writing about how much he sucks at life.  noah:  who the fuck is james?  mind you, i ve been at this place for 2 and a half months. reminded again that i m a piece of shit. 2:20   my article is a no go. i just nod my head and say i understand. there's only so many times i can write about sucking at life. 2:45   this is when my usual  big question of the day  comes where i annoy lawrence about some mundane shit going on in my life and ask his advice. the guy somehow has this uncanny knack of showing me how stupid of a question it is. every. fucking. time. like, there hasn t been one question that he hasn t absolutely made me think i have an iq of under 70 and should be considered legally retarded. i annoy the dude so bad i m sure he s contemplated punching me in my fucking face. the conversations ends with me feeling pretty bad about myself. 3:00   i send over some more product reviews to lawrence and don t even try making them the least bit entertaining. he s just going to edit it anyways. like, nothing is going on the site unless he adds at least three or four of his own jokes. more twitter time for me, what up. 3:10   i'm alone and can finally play the new riff raff song. super low volume, though. don t want to get caught with that shit. 3:14   lawrence walks in on me taking a photo booth shot. i need a new twitter avi, dude. get off my nuts! 3:30   lawrence goes on a spree of shitting on dumb commenters. 3:45   awkward silence. 4:00 - i have to borrow lawrence s entire wallet to go to the bathroom because it has the key card in it i need to get past all of the top notch, super confidential security checkpoints. i wash my hands and look for some paper towels and you know what i see? a roll of fucking toilet paper to dry my hands. like, not even 2-ply shit. do you have any idea how much it sucks to dry my perfectly manicured hands on a single ply of toilet paper? why the fuck are there never any paper towels in this place? 4:08 - overhear the new complex interns getting tours and receiving all of their security codes on their first day. you know what my boss did the first day? nothing. i didn t get shit. lawrence showed me a swivel chair and a little corner desk and said,  get to work.  it s a fucking ruthless dictatorship at four pins, dude. 4:10   realize my boss is running a glorified sweatshop. i don t even know what anything in the office looks like other than the wall right in front of my face. i think there s a water fountain in the place because daniel (another intern) is always sipping on a cup all obnoxious and shit while i die in the corner. somebody call the fda, ecc, naacp or whatever agency it is that handles child labor and war crimes. 4:15   bossman looks over at my screen and tweet deck is the only thing open. i don t even try to hide the fact i m not doing any work. 4:45   awkward silence. 5:00   soo-young comes into the cube and just absolutely ignores me. for those of you that don t know soo is a writer at complex that works right next to us. i swear to god, she hasn t acknowledged my existence once. one time there was an  alcohol  tasting thing at the office because complex is just cool like that and i caught her walking down the hall and was all like,  this is your chance, james. introduce yourself.  this is in one of the longest hallways i ve ever seen, mind you. no bullshit, she didn t even look at me. zero eye contact. it takes literally 3 minutes to walk through this hallway and i wasn t even noticed. i'm worse than the janitor, yo. 5:30   i send my last mediocre product review over to lawrence and i m done for the day. boom. easy as shit. so, there it is. the glamorous life of a four pins intern. no, i m not kicking it with the ovadia brothers and smoking weed with mark mcnairy as many of you think, but it s still pretty decent. in reality, i have a pretty good deal over here at four pins. i ve never fetched coffee, lawrence takes the time to amuse my nonsensical inquiries and nobody really knows my name so it's not like anyone can bother me. i mean, i'm not getting paid so it fucking sucks, but you get the point.         congratulations, homie! after landing a real job in the city you ve paid off your student loans and expelled all the peasant brands from your wardrobe. but the work has just begun. what? you thought you d arrived? it would all be gravy from here on out? living luxe is a never ending escalator my friend and the next step is getting your household in order. striking that ever so subtle balance between vintage and modern (toward which pole will your spot skew?) is harder than it looks.  but why?  you ask.  i don t care about interior design. that s for girls!  well, it comes down to the essential truth that dictates all male action tryna get some stank on your hang-down only now you re in a whole new pay grade. you might have fooled college girls and interns with your tailored ludlow suit and passable seiko, but now you re after real, professional ass women, and it takes more than some hardbottoms to get the oven started. even though they totally put their career first and don t want to conform to society s gender expectations, they might-just-maybe-still-want to have a baby and they need to know you ve got the means to buy, and the taste to decorate, their future home. this is crucial shit. sure, your twenties were about solidifying your closet, but this is an entirely different arena, old man. where to start? uh, the fucking internet, of course. here is our ultimate guide to pretentious interiors. angelo spagnolo is a writer living in portland, oregon. read his blog here and follow him on twitter here.         meet brandon sales, super rich (apparently), uk-born, designer (of his own brand, luxuryexcellence, because, of course), stylist (he dresses himself?), self-proclaimed influencer (we're not even fucking with you) and undisputed heavyweight hypebeast champion of the world. over the course of a few years, sales has made a name for himself by buying any and all designer fashions, putting them together in the corniest outfits possible and doing his best to befriend anyone even remotely famous enough to help him push his lifestyle terrorism. what's scary is that based on facebook and instagram, his plan is seemingly working. early this year he was interviewed at london fashion week about this outfit and his various exploits, to which he replied, i'm just going for that whole futuristic vibe [a] mix of kind of heavenly with the all-white. i don't know, it's something outrageous and different, i guess. so, yeah, dude is highly fluent in fashion buzzword fuckery, completely devoid of logic or, you know, an actual idea. but, of course, actions speak louder than words! brandon also sucks at those. his purchases are so lavish, so frequent, so shameless that it's almost like he's trying to ruin absolutely everything for the rest of us. while it's easy to say that we're simply hating on brandon, his personal style, hustle and money, stating such irresponsibly removes brandon of all accountability in terms of his pathetic, transparent thirst for the recognition of others. brandon, and anyone really, can play the hater card all they want, but at the end of the day, if you're relentlessly taking to social media to brag about your life, you better have skin as thick as your balmain leather. update: read our follow up interview with brandon sales here.         i'm pretty fucking sick of turning on the tv i wrestled off a pre-pubescent girl on black friday only to see these swagless nerds in their flag pin-adorned polyester suits talking about tangible increases in education and welfare spending. i don't care about any of that shit. i just care about your trash fucking fits. don't your colossal, ill-managed governmental budgets have room on the payroll for a presidential stylist? don't you siphon off enough public money to cop a prime ministerial pair of j's? smfh. but, like, what if? moksha august is a serial four pins commenter turned writer. i guess you could say that he started from the bottom. haha, that's the spot. you can follow him on twitter here.         as a highly-acclaimed og in the world of fashunz and digital medias (read: someone who has figured out how to make money in my pajamas), i've met a lot of talented dudes and dudettes. real talk, absent of my usual sarcasm, i've had the pleasure or working with and learning from some incredible inspiring, hard-working and talented creatives since i left the comforting structure of college for the harsh realities of real life. obviously, working mostly in fashion, i've met a lot of assholes who think their shoes or watch or haircut make them better than everybody else. but mostly it's been positive vibes. there is no magic formula for succeeding in a creative industry. among the various writers, editors, photographers, designers, stylists, brand managers, etc. that i've respected, there isn't one common trait that unites them, except that they all smoke hella weed. real talk, 98% of the $ucc$e$ful people i've worked with smoke dubious quantities of marijuana. the asshole with the haircut probably does real drugs and drinks cocktails he saw on mad men, but we're too old for real drugs and mad men hasn t been good for, like, four years. but a-lo, you question, being stoned doesn't really seem to gel with the get-shit-done attitude required to excel in the harsh world of digitized-creative-media-fashunz. this is true. being a productive stoner takes work. it takes good weed habits. you know that kid you went to college with who was stoned all the time, but still got a 4.0 and was captain of the swim team and the editor of the school paper? well, you're not him. this isn't college and you can't waste six hours vining to amped 3 once you've been in the real world and seen how much money you could make in that six hours. but fret not because the pinz is here to help you find a way to be stoned most of the time and avoid rotting away in a cubicle. though, if you do happen to be rotting away in a cubicle, you might as well be stoned all the time. let's run down the signature habits of the highly-effective stoner. angelo spagnolo is a writer living in portland, oregon. read his blog here and follow him on twitter here.         one would think that paying near obsessive attention to every facet of your wardrobe would lead to a concomitant increase in the amount of social activities and overall schmanging in your lifestyle. but it won t. and you re probably not even really aware of it yet because you re in too deep, mekhi. way. too. deep. or maybe it's already painfully obvious that you're being c-blocked. either way, you need to correct this shit asap. here are all the ways #menswear is ruining your sex life.         celebrities star in movies based on our lives and tv shows that simulate reality, but we re meant to imagine that offscreen they re swimming laps in vodka filled infinity pools, while all the women from maxim s latest issue serve them toffee popcorn. stars: they re just like, only pretending to be us! but kanye west s proposal to kim kardashian threw a wrench in the whole machine. and not even a gold-plated wrench, just some totally normal ass wrench from home depot or something. renting out a baseball stadium, getting a symphony to play lana del rey and then removing your girlfriend s blindfold so she can read the following text on a jumbotron:  pleeease marry meee!!!  this is the scene from the currently-in-production-film can you here, me now right after reese witherspoon quits her telemarketing job at a thinly-disguised verizon wireless and the company s ceo, played by josh duhamel in maybe a hairpiece, tricks her into coming to a stadium and proposes. this is not kim kardashian s real life. this is, like, basic. kanye claimed in a recent radio interview that,  it was very much a donda exercise. i sit with my team of creatives and we ll say,  what s the best version of this? how can we get this?   i love the idea that kanye west requires the donda creative team to help him achieve normalcy, and yet it s clear that no matter how high the level of orchestration, it was all done in the name of catering to kim s undeniable basic-ness. because, try as he might to dress her up in givenchy and celine, and blather as he may about what a worthy vogue cover girl she is, kanye knows that kim is capital-b basic, and if he wants to be with her, he s got to go basic too. just like how you sometimes have to go to t.g.i.friday s earnestly because your girlfriend likes their nachos, or how you ll wear a totally lamezo sweater she bought you from banana republic, or give up smoking even though it means nobody wants to take your fashionz picture now. and it all raises the terrible, heartbreaking, day-ruining question: when famous people fall in love, do they become...basic? are stars in love just like us? above, let's review some other stars who, once in love, became totally basic. rachel seville is a writer living in new york who believes in miracles. read her blog, pizza rulez, here and follow her on twitter here.         when i first read about the sacai x nike collaboration in february, i wanted to die just so a defibrillator from the brave new sacai x nike world could bring me back to life. i love sacai, and i love nike, and have actually worn them together on several occasions. and so it felt like two of my hottest and coolest friends finally met and one texted me the next morning to say, i hit, and i'm like, what else, and they're like, plus dome, and i'm like, hey man that's my best friend you're talking about. but more significantly, it felt as though nike was finally letting women in on a special and marvelous experience previously exclusive to menswear. yeah, womenswear is feeling ever more menswear-y, but the entire system of copping fire jawnz, of waiting and waiting with unbearable anticipation for an item to appear in stores or online, of salivating over a collaboration, that has been foreign to us. until now. finally, we were getting the legendary nikelab collaboration we deserved. because the pliable, fluid fabrics of athleisure lend themselves so gracefully to chitose abe's whole that is a nice shir oh my god it's a whole entire dress that's a coat thing, a notion confirmed by nike's otherworldly images, showing a woman running in a persimmon-and-punch kilt and accordion-pleated windbreaker ensemble that expanded in motion, like a jellyfish tearing it up at a marathon. there was no way this wasn't going to sell out in a snap, no way it wasn't going to be hyped every which way, which are publicity treatments rarely, if ever, seen in womenswear. yes, women were getting a chance to have the full hypebeast experience! and there was no way this experience was going to be wasted on me. i was ready to break my index finger hitting refresh just to spend too much of my money! do i work out? who actually cares?! this was gonna be my hypebeast moment, babies!!! first, i added the release date thursday, march 19 to my calendar. after a month that felt like the longest, most tragic month of my life, the day arrived. allegedly, the goods were supposed to go live on dover street market and nikelab's websites, but as dilettante, i had no idea when or how or why. i set my alarm for midnight thursday and found nothing. i checked again at 6:30am, an hour i do not recommend for anything except throwing your alarm and yelling, literally suck my dick, you foul-chimed beast! at 10:30am, there was still no sign of the stuff. i pictured a benevolent god in a white rick owens robe, patting my head. poor, sweet, amateur hypebeast, it said. i felt like a fool, so i decided to take action. i would go to the store! that would be even more genuinely hypebeast! off i dashed into the depths of soho, striking towards nikelab's 21 mercer location like a moth to a fire alphet. there i found a line of about 15 people that looked like it had as much a chance of moving as this one. i cackled. a line! lines for stores are designed to make them feel like clubs or russian supermarkets: abusively exclusive. which is very authentic hypebeast! i couldn't wait to wait with these...three hot japanese men in play comme des gar ons sweatshirts and those five bizarrely basic men in the kind of jeans worn by a guy who says things like, look, i'm a really nice guy, and this man dressed like a police officer! i was really living la vie en hypebeast now! to pass the time, i closed my eyes and imagined myself in the outfit i had decided upon two weeks before: a stiff gray sweatshirt, open in the back to reveal a veil of mesh and lime-green lace, matching skinny sweatpants and that magical windbreaker in gray. my neighbor i am in love with would see me in it, then play fashion killa (a highly personal anthem for me) on a boombox outside my window like a flossed out lloyd dobler. to pass more time and build up this fantasy, i decided to listen to fashion killa, but three minutes and fifty-six seconds later it was over, and i was still standing there, in the exact same place, between this police officer and one of those pesky men in those jeans. and it was very cold. i started to wonder, was the hypebeast life really all it was cracked up to be? a minute later, they let five people into a store that looked totally empty from outside, down here, on the street, where i stood with the rats and their fellow pests. i felt like a woman lost in the woods who had gotten all her knowledge about the woods from a sad, beautiful poem entitled 'four pins.' it then occurred to me that i was the only woman in line. must be some benevolent boyfriends out there! i both thought and tweeted. or not. because our world is a cruel one, i then realized, where the square moneymen are buying up our accordion pleated fire jawnz and selling them for dollars on the penny on ebay! now picture your dad, but five pounds thinner and with 1,000 extra dollars. he got out of an escalade and was let right in. i wanted to die, except maybe this time, i didn't even want to be brought back to life. if earth is for hypebeasts, maybe i was meant for heaven. but then something happened! (cool story, huh?) suddenly, a man appeared at the door and let seven people in, including me! this seemed like a twist on the average hypebeast experience, but i didn't linger on it. because there i was! in a store, like a real american girl! about eight other people were looking at the sacai goods with that particular mania that pools in the eyes when someone takes too much xanax. it felt coolly competitive. the rest of the crowd was in the back, surveying the glamorous sneakers i did not understand and could not afford. a man told me if i was actually going to buy something i would have to tell him what i desired and he would retrieve it from a mysterious labyrinth below the mother ship. so i said, cool. i wanted to poke through the other pieces, just to see what they looked and felt like, but i stopped myself. i felt like a woman lost in the woods who had gotten all her knowledge about the woods from a sad, beautiful poem entitled four pins. did i have time to pussyfoot around? i did not know! but i wasn't about to let my grails sell out from under me, so i grabbed the three pieces i had spent the last month of my whole life dreaming about and found a salesperson and announced myself: i would like to cop these now. he brought them upstairs and into my life. he asked me if i wanted to try them on, but, by this point, the inexplicable mania had seized me. i just wanted them in the bag before one of the eight other lucky people inside this store which i might add made me feel like i was in a meth lab run by yves behar poached them for their ebay lifestyle. i went to the cash register, where a very lovely woman rang up my purchases and, thankfully, mumbled my too high total as an incomprehensible jumble. (that inadvertent favor was perhaps the best customer service i have experienced in months.) then she packaged my beautiful sweatsuit and jacket into a garment bag, like it really mattered. enjoy, she said and i went off to do just that. at long last, the hypebeast glass ceiling had been broken. [photos via style dot com] rachel seville is a writer living in new york who believes in miracles. read her blog, pizza rulez, here and follow her on twitter here.         justin bieber is tight. i believe that and i came here to preach that. but yo, i haven't been that up on the latest news. i was unaware until i was googling some bieber facts that a newly released video showed the then 14-year-old bieber dropping n-bombs like kramer at laugh factory. i can't condone that. but, as a fellow small-town lad, i can understand how bieber could have grown up ignorant to the violence of his language. anyway, as chris brown, who publicly defended bieber's slur, shows us, if you make hits people will forgive the worst of your personality. but if we time warp back a couple of weeks and assume justin bieber is not a racist, but really just a 20-year-old with a blank check, a tattoo addiction and a desperate need for a competent stylist, i'll get back on my rant shit. justin bieber doesn't have a problem, you do. the biebs is the national tyler durden to our collective edward norton: he looks like we wanna look (aside from, you know, the clothes), he fucks like we wanna fuck and, most importantly, he is free in all the ways that you are not because he is super fucking rich. he's an easy target and that's before you consider he's canadian. we hold him up and whip him for indulging in the very excesses we ourselves yearn for. but i'm not here to pile on. nope. i will sign up right now this very second to surf a supermodel's body around the globe on waves of canadian loonies, while selena gomez shovels an avalanche of blowcane into my nostrils. who wouldn't? bieber's mother famously and smartly had a vice grip on her son's early career. presumably, she kept him from wasting money on all the ignorant shit 15-year-olds would buy with millions of dollars (read: slam ball courts). she also probably kept baby-seeking groupies out of her son's trailer, which i'm sure infuriated a young justin who, at any give moment, had a legion of teen girls at his liege. basically, when homie turned 18, he was bound to get turnt because his mom was finally off his back. bieber's not going crazy. he's just in college. only his dormroom is a penthouse suite and the cute girl from soc 101 is a victoria s secret model. think about all the things you did when you were 18-20 that you wouldn't want your mother to see or hear? now imagine those events amplified by access to unlimited cash and drugs. then add in the omnipresent paparazzi and camera phones. you're not even remotely famous and think of how much ridiculous footage there still is of you online. if i had a plane at 19 there would be no other option than to hot box that shit all the way to the super bowl. i've made this same exact argument about miley: how hard would you wil' if you could wil' as hard as you could, but also if you had a billion dollars? if you're not thinking to yourself, pretty fucking hard, you're probably no fun.  if there's a path for bieber to sustained career redemption, look to britney as a lighthouse.  justin's clothes game, though? yeah, we can all agree it's wack beyond measure. but that's pretty much the case with every pop star ever. google justin timberlake 1999. if nobody in your life ever told you that you looked stupid (except, maybe, your mom) how would you dress? if you had the dough to armor yourself in balmain, you could convince yourself that quantity of money spent directly correlated to looking dope. justin, real talk though, holler at your friends here at the pinz. we will change your whole life with one shopping trip and only charge, like, $200k for the consulting fee. we'll help you chill your shit out a bit and you'll be thankful in three years when you need to pawn your collection of drop crotch sweats for drug money. plenty of pop stars have danced atop the world's titties and fell violently from its nubby peaks, so our boy justin's not in the clear just yet. he's still incredibly young, which means he has room either to salvage his image or torpedo it to even greater depths with behavior even worse than what we've seen thus far. but just as the populace has somewhat forgiven the aforementioned batterer chris brown, we may too forgive bieber of almost anything next to a murder conviction as long as he keeps making music that satisfies our earholes. and, yes, i'm going on record saying that justin makes good, solid pop music. dude can sing. he has impeccable bone structure. he is worth salvaging. while i don t think a timberlake-like golden boy image is attainable for bieber at this point, there is a precedent. remember ...baby one more time britney spears? i had six six britney rolling stone covers on my bedroom wall (which, kids, were, like, a primitive, analog tumblr dashboard). then, remember head-shaving britney? not a single, non-tabloid cover from that era exists. but then you look up and britney's still here. her career has spanned more than 15 years, produced solid, regular albums and, at age 32, landed her the modern day pop star pot of gold, a las vegas residency. if there's a path for bieber to sustained career redemption, look to britney as a lighthouse. the next few years are going to be crucial for yung biebs. i suggest getting back with selena and just settling down with her for awhile. maybe even make some slow-cooked carnitas, stay in and watch a movie. hit semi-hiatus mode and cook up some heat with 'ye and rick rubin on a gritty track featuring a pusha verse about redemption. our forgiveness is just waiting for you with open arms. angelo spagnolo is a writer living in portland, oregon. read his blog here and follow him on twitter here.         first off, notice how i didn't say 10 things because i know how butthurt you pussies get when we start dropping numbered lists. the young fly prophet elijah mohammed made the pilgrimage to the mecca that is nyc for his first fashion week and is here to bless you even though you don't deserve it. try telling people in iowa you're going to fashion week when you're black. they're either jealous, but apprehensive because they think you're hitting up pelle pelle s/s 14 or they're loling because black people don't fashion. well, corny motherfuckers, i fashion'd the fuck outta this place. you re bananas if you didn t think that was gonna happen, but your boy also learnt a few lessons along the way. it ain't all sunshine and lollipops and gumdrop farts in this bitch, even when you're ridiculously good looking, ridiculously athletic and, overall, just a person peasants should be aspiring to.         ah, the glamorous life of a freelance writer. putting together #menswear prose whenever you please is the musical equivalent of freely composing a beautiful symphony for the opera house of your choosing, right? wrong, motherfucker! this shit is angst-inducing as fuck. obviously, constantly feeling the pressure to produce quality material is something we all can relate to, but when it comes to #menswear, it's a whole 'nother ballgame. as a freelance menswear writer, you aren't guaranteed paid work, like, ever. you have to go through some drastic, borderline questionable shit to get that byline nowadays. and trust, everyone is gunning for a byline. shit, some of these lowlife leeches will do your paid work for free (read: every four pins writer). this ain't no walk in the park, so let me show just how incredulous this shit can get.         when zig ziglar passed away last year, the world's greatest candle of motivation was suddenly extinguished. the masses were lost, left aimlessly searching for somebody, anybody, to inspire them towards greatness. but here at four pins, we've had marcus troy all along. some of you may know marcus as the montreal-based prolific blogger, tweeter and instagram icon. we know marcus as the unwavering guiding light pushing us to be the best possible version of our personal brand that we could ever hope to brand. from influencing influencers to making taste for tastemakers, the marcus troy experience    has never failed to deliver excellence always, in all ways. his secrets of success have single-handedly built everything we've ever achieved and we refuse to keep it to ourselves any longer. so get ready because you, dear reader, are about to become privy to the kind of information that will make even your wildest of dreams come true. we've scoured every corner of the web that was ever lucky enough to ever be graced by the presence of marcus troy and meticulously packaged his wisdom into a digital ark of prestigious curation. the following gallery of motivational posters are not for the faint of influence. read them. study them. print them out and hang them on your wall. but, most importantly, live them. because this is marcus troy. and these are his thoughts. and these are his truths.         yo i just woke up from a xanap and was thinking about items of clothing that make a statement. statement pieces is what i would call them if i was a european jerkoff with a fauxhawk that was a stylist. now a statement piece can say positive things and it can say negative things b. you feel me? niggas can look at an item of clothing you are wearing and draw a conclusion from that shit. oh you're wearing a scarf in july? you are wild duffable. oh you're wearing flipflops to your farmers market in december? you're clearly a white person. you know? and so on and so forth. also worth noting that if you look at certain statement pieces through the lens of time the statement the can change dramatically. which brings me to the statement of this piece. if you wear nba jeans you are sending a very clear message. that message is most likely i have discharged a firearm with the intent to merk a nigga. if you see a dude with nba jeans on in 2014 homie has definitely had to make homemade alcoholic beverages at some point in his life nahmean. originally me and my pal desus came to this conclusion on our show desus vs mero (plug) these sartorial theories are based on our combined years of research chillin with goon niggas in the wild savage lands of the bronx nahmean. like the true religion theory which i'm not gonna tell you here because go subscribe to the podcast. yo remember when nba jeans was the shit though? i could never get into it. i hate shit on my jeans, unless they were girbauds with the straps. yo deandre jordan is a horrible free throw shooter b! how you airball a freethrow? are you drunk my nigga? anyway yeah remember when nba jeans was poppin? yo i seen a rare joint where all the logos was fubu shoe khaki. nba jeans were made to rock with lugz b. if you see a guy in nba jeans you need to vacate because homie is either a goon or a puerto rican uncle that just came home and is wearing all his nephews old shit. stuff like nba jeans is good because if you are a female lookin for a dude to pillage you can spot and stay away from a nigga in nba jeans because you know his last good year was 2003. here's a little timeline to school all you muthafuckas that are late and don't know about the nba jeans. 2003ish - nba patch jeans appear on the scene. 2004ish - nba patch jeans have been worn in every rap video. 2005ish - nba patch jeans are over b. they are over so let them go find their special place of soliloquy. those dates are probably wild inaccurate but guess what? i'm drunk and i'm hittin this puffco so you niggas can go paint a house if you wanted some in depth information on nba jeans. also: if you want in depth information about nba jeans you got problems i can't even solve so you need to contact every daytime talk show host and see if they'll let you talk about the shit while you weep openly. hold up! hold my phone. tosses you the phone the kid mero is a writer living in new york. you can read his blog, victory light, here and follow him on twitter here.         springtime. the devil's playground. ol' flowery. fuck city, usa. whatever you call it, it spells results. personally, i don't call any of the seasons by their unenlightened names because it's rude and cuz i'm not a goddamn infant. instead, i refer to them by their respectful monikers: sting's friend, lil raoul, sexy bigtime and cold sexy bigtime. but how can you have the best darn lil raoul possible? read on, my love. read on and give me five thousand dollars. section one: proper attire look up in the sky. no, the other sky. see that the sun? some background: the sun is your hot friend from space, the one who will kill you if you touch it, but also kill you if it goes away. yeah, like marina. except without the part where it tries to steer the conversation to be about mummies every time. i fucking know, marina, they took the brains out thru the nose. everyone knows. you sweaaaar you special cuz you watched the discovery channel that one time. i could have discovery channel too if i wanted. don't get gassed. but because this the sun tends to spice things up, you may find yourself needing a lil clothing guidance. as winner of forbes magazine's sir, i know i told you the water fountain is free, and it is. i'm not disputing that. but you've been here for over five hours and i'm calling the police award, i am the only one fit to steer you toward clothed bliss. 1a. north face jackets in colder times, you stepped out of your filthy stupid house wearing, on average, eight to ten north faces. more perhaps if you were going to a fanciful opera contest or knife fight. this time of year though, it's prudent to cut back to a conservative four or five at most. unless it's your birthday. if it is your birthday, ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww dog, your parents did sex!!!!! groooosssssssss. you grossin' me out and you have to leave. 1b. pants make sure the north face jackets you wear around your legs are cinched tight and snug or the mayor will fuck you up for lookin' foolish. which brings me to my next point. 1c. lookin' foolish the silent killer. avoid!!! section two: food and drink (or hey! pizza! lets diiiiig in!) 1. jujubes now that it is springtime you can finally buy delicious jujubes brand candy. i hear you already, but couldn't i do that year-round? firstly, don't you ever fucking talk to me like that in front of company. secondly, yes. but you didn't, did you? exactly. 2. if a poisonous snake bites me will i still die even though it is springtime? yes. what is important to remember is that springtime is not magic. write it on your binder if need be. if you are too old to have a binder, fall in love and create a child with someone who makes the inescapable grey mundanity of our pitiful existence seem like the beautiful quiet intermission betwixt two symphonies that it truly is, and when the kid gets old enough, put it on that lil idiot's binder. plus, if you go to the movies you can point to the kid like it is him who is going to the movies and the ticket will be cheap. then, you can put the kid in your pocket or into cryosleep and you use the ticket. the system works. section three: sassy springtime activities 1. go to the park and look at a balloon like a guy in a french movie. 2. read a book (....or is it?). 3. rock out. (this one seems obvious, but people stay asking me dumb shit like, what time is it? and time isn't even real, soo...) 4. look at a picture of you when you were a baby. you're dying, raymond. you're dying and everyone knows. 5. it has come to my attention by watching the maury povich program that many of you filthbuckets have been engaging in the practice of sending photolithographs of your nudity to like-minded sinners. this ends here. sexting is over. the new hot springtime trend is networkxting. instead of ribald pictorials (that make the bible cry, i'll have you know) with thirstful captions such as hello hot stuff look at my skin, you send people pictures of your outstretched hand with captions such as put 'er there, sam.  now you are getting ahead in business, which is what this season is all about. in the spaces provided below, write in your own fun spring behaviors! 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. (okay, this one just ain't right. fam, i don't care if you're joking. this is why they had to use twins to play michelle on full house. ain't nothin' funny about that. matter of fact, i swear i asked you to leave.) [photo via feelgrafix] dvs is a rap mutant/earth's greatest supervillain/invented the remix. read/listen to his guilt-free macrobiotic recipes on twitter and bandcamp.         as far as my favorite brands that i don't actually own yet are concerned, cash ca pretty much tops the list. and i say yet because this holiday season i've forsaken all my loved ones and just buying myself presents. you're probably thinking, um, how is that any different than the other days of the year? and you're kind of right. except, sometimes i gotta buy my girlfriend dinner and stuff because she's sitting at the same table as me. this sweatshirt hits all the right notes for me, though, which is why my girl will get a coupon book for free hugs and what not this year. if you guys are super broke and can't afford to buy your significant others any presents whatsoever, just go down on them for, like, 3 hours.         1:35am, april 2, 2015: i can't sleep. i am laying in bed thinking about the jorts. will this be a good or bad idea? i hope that my thighs don't hurt too much from doing too many rap squats while wearing these tight ass jorts. according to urban dictionary, jorts are jean shorts that are worn mostly by children and douchebags. if there has ever been a reason not to go to urban dictionary for any guidance or wisdom whatsoever than this here is it. the article does go on to say: the term 'jorts' does not apply to jean shorts worn by black people, as those are entire acceptable. i am a black person, so it's acceptable. jorts are merely an extension of being a human being. everyone should wear them. i have about four pairs that i rotate throughout the week. since i am an authentic jorts wearer i make mine from old jeans. i even have a special drawer that is full of the bottom half of the leftover fabric from the jeans that have been blessed.  the idea of wearing jorts to prom was something that kind of started as a joke or kind of like that guy that tells everyone that he's not going to college and he's going to be in this band with his bros, but he eventually succumbs and goes to college to be a businessman like his dad, except i decided, nope, i am not going to succumb. if i am going to go to prom i am doing it my way. my dad wasn't too keen with the idea, but my date was on board with me wearing jorts and for the rest of my alphet i drew inspiration from pharrell's 2014 oscar look. 1:28pm: i am going to wear the black jorts as they are my most formal option. i don't want to go with the blue ones because i don't want to look like some teen that works on a farm and i don't want to go with the light blue ones because with the outfit it screams etsy vegan spring wedding and that's not what we, my date and i, are going for. i am cutting the frayed ends of the jorts more closely so my date's mom doesn't think i'm a hoodlum who isn't housebroken. 2:02pm: when will it be 5? i want to stunt and officially take the crown as the dude who wore jorts to prom and totally nailed it. 4:40pm: the jorts are on and i look like trash. i take them off. i am brainstorming how to fix this hot mess. maybe if i add a bow tie it won't look as bad.  5:15pm: i posted a picture of my outfit on twitter dot com and a follower of mine says, rock the fuck on. this is a good stunt. i feel better. 5:30pm: just switched out my adidas sl loops back to my all black vans and the outfit looks better. 5:59pm: my dad just came downstairs and looks me up and down a lot. i wonder if his neck and head hurt. he makes me take several pictures outside of our house. some of these pictures i'm sure will go on his facebook. all of his friends will probably think i look weird.  6:38pm: i am at the house where we are supposed to take couples' pictures. several parents have complimented me. they say that it matches me and my date's outfit. my dad is proudly calling me pharrell. i think this is his proudest moment as a father. i should have put more lotion on my ankles.  7:33pm: we leave the place where we take couples' pictures and arrive at a place where we will allegedly do marijuanas. someone compliments my attire. i say that because they don't explicitly say they like my jorts, just, nice attire. this is not what i did this for. this is the equivalent of kris jenner only offering kanye the compliment good job after hearing one of his songs. 7:45pm: there is a dog that keeps coming near me and i am scared. i have heard that dogs can smell fear and i do not know if the jorts are making it worse. but i did not get this dressed up to be mauled by a goddamn dog before prom even starts. i am high.  7:58pm: i am now in the car and have been djing for about 20 minutes. i have never had the aux cord passed to me for this long. i do not know if it is because i made such a bold statement with the jorts that the other passengers think that i will make bold music choices or they just really like if you're reading this it's too late. tequila is good. 8:28pm: we are at burger king. i do not order anything. my date does. i turn around with my back facing the counter and right as i turn the woman at the register looks at me in disgust. why are you mad, baby love? you don't like jorts? 8:52pm: i make it into prom. someone calls my jorts trousers. i am too lit to tell them that they are, in fact, not trousers. they are jorts. 8:54pm: my school counselor walks by, does a double take and comes back to look at me. she says i am a fashion icon, continuously making statements with my style. i wonder if she has seen yeezy season 1? i am at the point of compliments where i wonder if everyone is regina georging me, telling me to my face that they like my jorts and then turning around to their friends and telling them i look like trash. 9:07pm: i do my second rap squat of the night. i need to do more. the kid i rap squat with and his date attempt to question my sexuality by subtly trying to ask where my date is by using a male pronoun. was it the jorts that made them think it was a good idea to make make such an ignorant remark?  10:06pm: it is awkward as fuck seeing a friend that you don't fuck with anymore. this observation is independent of wearing jorts. 10:15pm: as i type my notes for the evening so i can write this, i'm being stared at by some bros. i think it's because i have been dancing with several dudes' dates that aren't mine and they feel some sort of way about it. i am sorry that the ladies love my jorts and that i possess rhythm on every song and not just songs where the lyrics are explicit instructions on how to dance. 10:42pm: i'm outside with some people because inside it is hotter than natural hair under a quick weave and someone asks me if i designed this outfit myself. to consider myself a designer just because i am wearing this is an insult to all the designers that came before me, so i say, kind of. 10:48pm: my date tells me she is leaving at 11 with the group that i came with. but i am not leaving. no yet. we still have an hour left at prom. does this mean she is ditching me or am i ditching her? i haven't danced with my date once. hopefully, me staying results in hearing jam by kim kardashian. 10:57pm: trap queen sounds better when you are wearing jorts at prom. this is a fact.  11:00pm: i am standing in my own zone when someone came up to me and goes, oh my god, have you been wearing that the whole night? i confirm their suspicions. they yell, oh my god, you're a savage! in 2015, it is good to be labeled as a savage according to the vernacular of the youth. 11:25pm: people are currently going crazy for that footloose song. i have not heard louder screams all night. they are screaming like they just found out that they are all going to college for free. i have only seen the newest version of footloose and there was a lot of grinding and jorts, but i can't grind to this. i go to sit down. 12:01am, april 3, 2015:  my jorts feel extremely tight right now. my thighs hurt. i did not do enough squats to prepare for the rap squats that i did tonight. the last song is playing right now. it's don t stop believing. i did not stop believing that they would play decent music and here i am in a circle, embracing with people singing don't stop believing. 1:01am: i arrive home. the jorts are off. i lay in my bed listening to legend by drake to cleanse my soul. i wore jorts to prom. malcolm musoni wore jorts to prom. follow him on twitter here.         when i went to school i used to wear the same clothes, they used to laugh and joke but now i m fucking all these ns' hoes. - speaker knockerz i'm not sure when it happened, but there came a point in which i became unable to wear anything that wasn't black. color felt like i was screaming at people. blue! i'm wearing a blue shirt! look at my blue shirt! the way i already had felt about graphic tees, logos and jewelry began to recede dangerously. now i was limited to black, my only choices amongst different textures and silhouettes. black felt subdued, like i wasn't making a statement. or, rather, i could pretend to myself that it was me that people were seeing instead of some ridiculous items with which i had chosen to define my appearance. i shuddered at the thought of a yellow, just the fact of it being so incredibly, inescapably fucking yellow. my whole life has been a sisyphean exercise in trying to look less silly. adolescence was a series of oversized hand-me-downs from my father. a classmate of mine came up to me once and asked if my parents were unemployed, ostensibly because i was dressed like shit. but as a kid, you don't care because the overwhelming anxiety associated with the fact that people can actually see you has not nestled itself comfortably in your psyche yet. i neither look at myself really, nor did i think about myself as an object. i just sort of walked through life like a first-person shooter. but as that reality sets in, you start to curate. you start rejecting. you reject logos. you reject flash. you reject unnecessary embellishments. you reject formal. you reject prep. you reject americana. you reject streetwear. it all just seems so stupid, all of those aesthetics, but you care so much about having the right thing. you're trying to wife, not phase in and out looks, while constantly having to experience the kanye kill self moment when you see pictures of yourself from the previous year. before you know it, your closet consists of only black t-shirts, black hoodies, black jeans, black sneakers and black jackets. and, if you do the same thing every day, it will become you. people will consistently question your choice. they will ask you if even your boxers are black (they are). just like that you've lost control. you've become a parody of yourself, unable to find the escape from judgment that avoiding colors was supposed to afford you. someone recently asked me if i wanted to try doing whippets, but before i could answer, my friend next to me responded, 'alex has worn the same outfit for his entire life. he's not about to take a new risk.' i wore a grey sweater for a few days any my entire world fell apart. people were asking each other how they felt about the fact that i had switched it up. it was an event. this part of it is actually kind of tight. you have the ability to make a choice that genuinely shocks the people around you just by putting on some indigo once in a while, or rocking that all white when you're feeling godly. but once backed into the all black everything corner, it's impossible to fully escape. nothing else feels quite right. you've become an uniformed icon. everyone who knows you can't imagine you in any other form. steve jobs doesn't make sense without the turtleneck, or jordan without the bulls jersey. no one remembers frieza's three preliminary forms. i eventually had to put that grey sweater back in the closet. it had been adding entirely too much stress to my day. someone recently asked me if i wanted to try doing whippets, but before i could answer, my friend next to me responded, alex has worn the same outfit for his entire life. he's not about to take a new risk. but that was never what it was about. it was about not giving people the chance to judge you based on what you're wearing. we ve all assumed someone is completely undeserving of life on this earth based on seeing them wear a t-shirt that says something like, beer pong champion. why sell yourself short like that? why lend your identity to a slogan, a brand or even a sports team? to wear all black is to try to give yourself the clean slate, and to give others as little as possible. but there's no getting away from the fact that you've made a choice. you've voted. this is the way that you're presenting yourself as kind of a coward, at the end of the day. so, wear some stupid shit whenever you can gather the courage and refuse to consider what anyone thinks of your t-shirt that expresses your unique fondness for the game and artistry of beer pong. say it broadly and proudly across your chest. it's liberating, i would imagine. i mean, i don't know. i've never tried it. alex russell is dressed in all black like the omen. he'll have your friends singing, this is for my homies. follow him on twitter here.         it s an honor to be tapped to pen the inaugural four pins man of the year profile. there is no shortage of great and honorable men we could bestow this honor upon. i mean, fuck it, we re not even limited to dudes who are alive right now. posthumous awards are gonna be so hot for 2014. so, who is the man who rose above all others this past year? who has a social and cultural impact beyond his peers? who, in the year of mandela s passing, snowden s revelations and yeezus' birth, could shine brightest? who could possibly live up to these august heights? scott spencer storch, that s fucking who. who is scott storch? only a former member of the roots who went on to date lil' kim and make the lean back beat for fat joe, earn 60 million dollars only to blow it all bumpin' cocaine and, most likely, towards the end, have sex with decidedly mediocre chicks from tampa. that kind of lifestyle trajectory is the kind we here at four pins fully endorse. let s get familiar with the founder of storchaveli recordings. the former roots keyboardist turned hitmaker hasn t let his declaration of bankruptcy keep him down. he's wild active on instagram, posting amazing videos of him going fucking crazy on those keys while smoking a cigarette, while getting his hair did, while wearing sunglasses indoors. smg will never stop. and like any true g, storch s dog even has its own instagram account. what's his dog s name? duey_blaze, official smg dog. what kind of photos does an animal of this magnitude post to his own insta? photos like this. there is a plethora of interviews in which storch is asked about the time he spent almost exclusively doing cocaine, buying things and just generally doing what we all would do given $60 mil. um '06, '07, '05 '08...  that s how storch answered the question,  which years were you partying the hardest? you know you were doing hella drugs and crazy ass shit when you can t even put that time period into proper chronological order. i need to know what happened in 2005 to remind storch of that year after already rifling off '06 and '07. can you imagine? even i can t remember what happened in 2005. but i totally remember that time in 2000 when a girl let me touch her boob in majorca. so, you know whatever storch thinks of when 2005 comes up must be out of this universe. when the bank account runs dry and the coke wears off, you re left with nothing but the innate harshness of reality. to this day, storch retains a healthy perspective on his journey. on going broke and his problem with cocaine: it wasn t exactly the cost of cocaine that made me break a lot of my money. on the rumors he left janet jackson at his studio for 10 hours alone: it was four hours. it was bad though. although, to be honest, if you had 60 million dollars to spend and a problematic relationship with the yayo, you d probably run a little late every once in a while too. storchavelli is even man enough to admit that at one point he ran out of stupid shit to buy. he went from copping sensible shit like a fleet of bugattis to buying a set of diamond encrusted perfume bottles for no reason, only to have some drunk girl sit on his counter and break one. i need to live like this for just one month. but storch s rise and fall is fable for all of us. with all the stories of excess, of banging a-listers, there comes the crash and crush of reality. when the bank account runs dry and the coke wears off, you re left with nothing but the innate harshness of reality. the reality that comes with blowing all your money on cars, drugs, and women? these guys now feels comfortable being part of your entourage. kobe bryant once recognized you outside of a club some club in miami and now a bunch of creepy uncles kick it with you in the studio. of course, no man of the year is without his faults. the debilitating drug habit, the egregious reliance on giant sunglasses, wearing this jacket these aren t faults. they re lovable character quirks. storch s greatest fault? making beats for brooke hogan. like rick james, another great man, once said before him, cocaine is a helluva drug. but through every adversity, storch never lost site of his god given talent. i mean, this man is a visionary. kim k. used to kick it with scott storch. he was on trend years before kanye. kim kardashian was scott storch s leather jogging pants. so, as 2013 winds down, we'd like to close shit out with a twenty one gun salute in honor of scott storch and his impossibly wise teachings on how to properly blow upwards of 60 million dollars. plus, that riff on still d.r.e. was pretty fucking dope. original photograph by maicol diaz         back in 2009, i was sitting in a bar with my friend west and a few other colleagues while he told a college story: west and his friends were stuck in traffic leaving a football game. he started running his mouth when he saw some of the other team's fans in the truck next to them. the shit talking escalated quickly and, suddenly, both west and an opposing fan hopped out of the car to scrap. west advanced, ready throw hands, but before he could swing, got punched in the face so hard his pants fell down. he then tripped and fell and everyone else who was stuck in traffic started raucously laughing at him. wow. i was beside myself. this was the kind of story you bury and never tell a soul, let alone retell for coworkers 10 years later as entertainment. and yet, everyone was laughing with him, west the hardest. he left the bar with the most beautiful girl in the group that night. getting punched in the face and having your pants fall down in front of a huge crowd is the stuff of most people's nightmares. however, by retelling the story frequently and skillfully, west took this tremendous l and turned it to his advantage. instead of allowing it to be a weakness, he owned this hilarious moment and made it a point of pride. i learned an important lesson that night. have you taken an l recently? you don't have to answer that because you regularly read websites about expensive clothing, so i know you have. how did you react? did it upset you? did it fuck with your pride? one major disadvantage of taking yourself too seriously is that every loss has two hits: when it happens and when it comes up later to embarrass you. you need to let that ego go. accept the fact that you're not perfect as perfection is a goal of the naive. so, next time you take a massive l, breath in a deep breath, let that shit wash over you and learn to laugh about it. recognize the humor. didn't get that job offer because you unintentionally made a racist joke during the interview? roll with it and turn it into a story of redemption. did someone hilariously dunk on you on twitter? retweet the slander. you can use any failed moment to your advantage by owning it and building on it so it becomes your story, instead of giving it the power to control you. to illustrate my point, i've provide examples of the correct and incorrect way to process one's losses below:  taking l's case study: drake drake is the master of turning his weaknesses into strengths. i mean, this is a guy who started out as a child actor on a show where he got shot in the back for bullying some kid (wow, this was truly l inception, an l within an l), which would be damning evidence for anyone trying to be tough in raps. but aubrey owns that shit and acknowledges that this is a crucial part of his story and success, flipping it into lyrics about how he doesn't fuck with anyone anymore. continuing, an on-camera moment of him compulsively lint rolling his pants at a raptors game could've just become another meme about corniness. he ingeniously responded by creating ovo-branded lint rollers. see, drake firmly understands that losses are part of life and recognizes them as moments to humanize himself. this has in turn enabled him to become arguably the most popular rapper alive, one who you've undoubtedly thought wrote songs about your own life because he's so goddamn relatable.  taking l's case study: joe budden i almost feel bad using joe budden as an example because this man may have taken more losses than any other rapper in the history of rap. in 2003, he was a young man with a hot, just blaze-produced single and tons of potential. some twelve years later, thanks largely to the unbeatable self-humiliation combo of a garbage twitter account and a reoccurring role on love & hip hop, joe's public losses include, but are not limited to: a failed marriage proposal on tv, getting punched in the eye by raekwon, threatening people who clown him online and, of course, a too expertly manicured beard. if you are any sort of celebrity and threatening violence towards randos on twitter because they made fun of you, you've already lost completely. joe's biggest problem was that with each l he took, instead of rolling with the punches, he reacted emotionally, creating even more public missteps that led to compounding humiliation. assuming you're even going to begin in the first place, you gotta know when to just call it quits. so, there it is. admittedly nothing monumental, but with summer aka l season right around the corner, a message that deserves repeating. if you don't take yourself too seriously, almost anything can be turned to your benefit. handling your l's like a boss only serves to

[lead image via groundislava/twitter]         one of the internet's favorite pastimes is having opinions about macklemore. this is not because he is a particularly good or interesting rapper, but instead because he is a particularly non-good and non-interesting rapper who is extremely popular and has more money than everyone who has ever blogged about him combined. he seems to understand that he pisses people off and acts like he feels vaguely bad about it, which is even more maddening to people on who did not make thrift shop. and just when you think the discourse around macklemore has quieted down, mr. steal-yo-grampa's-clothes tends to find a way to reinsert himself into rap's conversation, or at least finds the conversation thrust upon him. yesterday, we found ourselves engaged yet again in first-degree talking about macklemore when it came to our attention that he d beaten out kendrick lamar at the grammys for best rap album, and then texted him about how he felt bad he d beaten him, and then posted an instagram of that text to show that he was really really sorry about it. this prompted yet another round of anti-macklemore thinkpiecery. now, allow me to be clear people who are genuinely surprised upset that macklemore won a bunch of grammys are fucking idiots. the grammys, and any award ceremony on tv for that matter, are not an actual metric of the taste of young people who like good things. if they were, gucci mane would have a million grammys and killa season would have won best picture in addition to going platinum, stupid. just because kendrick lamar, a musician we actually like for once, was nominated for a bunch of grammys doesn't mean they were going to magically get less shitty. you think i give a fuck about a grammy? eminem once rapped, and he was right in doing so. all awards are arbitrary just like the fact that we will all die alone. still, there s this nagging, sinking feeling that comes with thinking about macklemore s grammy wins. not because he won them by circumventing the paths to traditional hip-hop stardom and then pretended to feel bad about it, or because the so-called socially progressive message of songs like  same love  help blind people to his privilege, even as he, himself, starts a pro-gay marriage anthem by rapping, when i was in third grade, i thought i was gay, essentially the hella-liberal bro version of no homo. he is annoying for these reasons, sure. but what kills people the most about macklemore is that he's categorically fucking swagless. he used the phrase 'turn up function' to caption an instagram selfie he took with miley cyrus, which managed to siphon the swagger right out of words like 'turn up', 'function' and 'miley cyrus', relocating them directly to hell. the reason people who love rap hate macklemore is because it is embarrassing to have that dude be what adult, mainstream america thinks of when they think about hip-hop. now, when i say mainstream america, i don t mean your little cousin who works at aeropostale and gets buck at the applebee's in shelby, north carolina on a friday night. i mean your parents, your grandparents, your aunts and uncles, women with grey-blue wigs you might pass in the grocery store and pay no mind to, people with eyeballs and ears and souls who despite those eyeballs and ears and souls still have no fucking idea what rap music is. there is room enough in these people's brains for one rapper at a time to occupy their notion of rap music, and because he's just won a bunch of grammys and everyone is talking about him, right now that rapper is macklemore. and that's fucking horrifying. it makes me want to stop caring about rap and instead listen to some shit like polka because, at this point, even accordions are less embarrassing than macklemore. to wrap up, here are all of the reasons why macklemore is uncool and makes me, as a rap fan, shiver: he is an unfunny episode of portlandia brought to life, the personification of why the well-meaning american upper-middle-class is a fucking nightmare. his favorite movie is probably an inconvenient truth. saying, i am a macklemore fan in a mirror three times in a row will automatically make you donate to your local 4h club. his hair makes his head look like something you'd clean a dry erase board with. he used the phrase turn up function to caption an instagram selfie he took with miley cyrus, which managed to siphon the swagger right out of words like turn up, function and miley cyrus, relocating them directly to hell. the face he uses in his said selfies is the sort of smug, self-satisfied grin that just begs to be punched off of someone's fucking face. macklemore sucks because he tries to take hip-hop and make it goofy, fun and family-friendly, but does so in a way that makes it seem like he's making fun of it. he sucks because we shouldn t even have to debate whether or not he sucks because he shouldn t exist. he sucks because he seems like a nice guy, but he also sucks because meaning well can only get you so far. he sucks because his music is wild corny and makes him seem like he's really into reddit. he sucks because in the face of all his success he has only paid lip service to the idea that he might have become successful by taking advantage of the fact that he is white and good looking, and this gives everyone the sneaking suspicion that he just might suck because he is disingenuous and not actually worried about his privilege. and really, why should macklemore be contritious about his fame and success? he has millions of dollars and a bunch of grammys, and we have zero dollars and zero grammys because those things don t exist when you hold the moral high ground. all we have to cling to is our precious coolness, something macklemore gave up long ago on the road to fame and fortune. we are cool, macklemore is not, this is fucking awesome. drew millard wrote this while drinking sake on a suzuki in osaka bay. you can read more of his work over at noisey and follow him on twitter here.         alright, bring it in, guys. great hustle out there. really great stuff. now, i know it's hot out i mean, not hot enough to melt steel or anything, but still pretty hot so i don't have to remind you how important it is to stay hydrated, or that 9/11 was a conspiracy perpetrated by a shadowy cabal of various high-ranking government figures. you obviously all remember how last season ended. that totally in control demolition of the broncos is what we're striving for every game, and also exactly what happened to the two towers we all saw those little puffs of smoke. i want you to treat this training camp like it's the super bowl. this isn't the time for crisis actors. this is the real deal. i've got a few individual notes for some of you. percy, really great speed out there. faster than the missile that hit the pentagon that bright september morning. yes, a missile. check the gas station surveillance tape and tell me i'm wrong. russell, awesome job keeping those plays alive. you're like the opposite of norad you're always scrambling in time. kam, love the big body presence. keep it up! unlike building 7, which as we all know, apparently collapsed due to fire and structural damage. right. google this stuff, guys. infowars.com. loose change. marshawn, we're all glad to have you back. if there's one thing i can't stand, it's holdouts whether it's you holding out from training camp or the government holding out on releasing information about the day that changed our nation forever. okay now listen up, there are definitely a few areas that need improvement. the hustle was good, but it can always be better. don't look me in the eyes and tell me you're giving 100% if you're not giving 100%. i don't want to be lied to by my football team, and i don't want to be lied to by government officials who tell me to my face that there wasn't any thermite found at ground zero. this is mainly for the backs, but if you see a big enough hole, you gotta go for it. if you're having trouble remembering that, just think of the hole in the side of the pentagon you know, the 60-foot wide one that was supposedly created by a 125-foot wide plane. defense, you have to really want the ball. pretend you're alex jones and the ball is proof that the nwo orchestrated the attacks. again, great job out there, fellas. i know the regular season is close, but the preseason is closer, so i don't want you thinking too far ahead. not like the insider trading that took place immediately preceding 9/11. go take a look at the data and see for yourself. it's incontrovertible. we won it all last year and there's no reason we can t do it again. i'm proud of every single one of you. you've been working your butts of this whole camp and it makes me so happy to see that. alright, let's hit the showers. great work today, guys. love it. oh, and flight 93 actually landed safely in ohio. stefan j. is a writer living in vancouver. you can read his personal blog here and follow him on twitter here.         chuck palahniuk recently announced a follow-up to his seminal 1999 book, fight club. the sequel, a graphic novel, will focus on both the current life of the narrator, our unnamed protagonist, as well as the mysterious past of tyler durden. according to palahniuk, tyler is something that maybe has been around for centuries, leading to speculation that we'll be seeing him interact with various historical figures. in a four pins exclusive, we've been given several excerpts from the upcoming comic.    tyler durden: i'm back, motherfucker. unnamed protagonist slips and falls in the shower while jacking off. tyler durden: wassup.    tyler durden: i'm that little twinge you feel every time you order your fuckin' starbucks latte, extra foam. i'm the missing allen key from when you built your ikea table, the one you put your starbucks latte on when you're trying to pick something to watch on netflix. oh yeah, i'm netflix, too. unnamed protagonist: are you the feeling in the pit of my stomach when i eat fast food?

russell wilson: [stilted] hey guys, it's me, nfl quarterback russell wilson. vince: he's so self-aware, which makes it funnier. e: hey man, we're big fans. drama: not me. i'm going to profess to liking a different player and/or team in order to put us all in an awkward, comedic situation. turtle: drama, come on, man.    vince strides through the door. drama: baby bro, you see this shit? drama gestures to his laptop. cut to a buzzfeed article about the westboro baptist church. drama: [shaking head] religion is a disease.    turtle enters a subway restaurant and spots a cute sandwich artist. turtle: yeah, i'll get a cold cut combo on italian herbs and cheese. sandwich artist: 6 inch or footlong? turtle exaggeratedly lifts the brim of his snapback. turtle: you tell me. the sandwich artist is instantly smitten, somehow.    drama: hey baby bro, i made a vincent chase parody twitter account. vince: i don't know what that means. drama: it has 600,000 followers and all i do is tweet boring platitudes and pictures of spongebob squarepants smoking weed. turtle: wait, that's not vince s account?    the boys are sitting in a sweat lodge after drinking ayahuasca. joe rogan enters the lodge. rogan: guys how sick is this shit? vince: it's like this lodge is a womb. rogan: fuck, man. the whole world is a womb. all: whoa     vince: guys, we need to work on our catchphrases. drama: uh, baby bro, come on. mine is perfect. turtle: [sarcastically] drama mia? drama: yeah, well it's better than turtle so horny. turtle: hey, you know what? fuck you, drama. e: guys, guys, hey, whoa, whoa. vince: e, that's a terrible catchphrase.    drama: a salient point, turtle. but, and i hesitate to quote lacan once again, i... turtle lets loose an immense fart that lasts nearly a minute.    e: vince, i don't know how you did it, but you've somehow ended up back on your feet! vince: i know! it was like, whoa, my movie bombed. how am i going to recover from this one? and then i did! ari: shit. vince: what is it? ari: vince, you know that big role you just got? the one that makes up for your last movie completely bombing? vince: yeah. ari: they gave it to someone else. drama: drama mia! vince looks directly at the camera. vince: here we go again! stefan j. is a writer living in vancouver. you can read his personal blog here and follow him on twitter here.         this is completely unfair. i really think that i should be allowed to wear my cape to the funeral. you and sarah get to wear those cool little lace veils, which are essentially capes for your face. and don't get me started on that pillbox hat. it looks like just a fuckin' box on your head, which, in retrospect, is probably where it gets its name. who are you, jackie o? i just compared you to a cultural icon, but in a bad way. owned. are you still going on about that? first of all, it was a trilby. i don't know how many times i need to clarify that for you. secondly, and most importantly, everyone at the hospital loved it. uncle greg wanted to put it on, remember? but the nurses wouldn't let him because his skin was sloughing off? so yeah, operation wear a trilby to the severe burn ward was actually a complete success. here's me right now: good day, mother. i hope things are going well. if it pleases you, i intend to wear my extremely fashionable cape to uncle greg's funeral. before you object, let me present you with several irrefutable points in a calm and rational fashion. here s you: ah! blurg blarg blurg! hitler wore a cape! my son is a freak! you've brought shame on this family! ah! blurg blarg blurg! there's nothing morbid or thoughtless about wearing a cape to greg's funeral. i'll be wearing a new cape, not the one that caught on fire when i stood next to the stove for too long. this one is inflammable. or, wait, that means it can still catch on fire? infireable. it's infireable. oh, like you would have done anything different. my cape was on fire, mother, so yes, i whipped around in a frenzy. yes, greg was standing there. yes, the cape got caught on his face. yes, mistakes were made. but it's all in the past now. we've been over this. aunt beth agreed not to press charges. i'm wearing the cape, and i'm going to walk into the church and dramatically swish it around. people will love it. there will be applause, at a funeral, because of my...capeabilities. you do not know how long i've been waiting to use that. you wouldn't want somebody doing that at your funeral, now would you? uh, earth to mom, i'd be dead. so yeah, i wouldn't give a shit. duh. and, again, we've been over this before too. i'm not having a boring old funeral. i want you to heave my corpse out of a moving car just like in cinematic masterpiece bad boys ii. it's all laid out in the instructional video i emailed you, life without your handsome son. you know what? fuck this. i'm wearing the cape and you can't stop me. i can fold it up and use it as a seat cushion, it encourages me to walk quickly, so it billows out behind me, and it looks good as hell. it's like uncle greg always screamed, your cape is on fire! no, mom, he was speaking literally and metaphorically. if it makes you feel any better, i'll toss my cape onto the casket as it's being lowered into the ground. it's what greg would have wanted if he were still alive to see his own funeral, tom sawyer style. you're goddamn right i just used a literary allusion in my cape argument. now, what's the food situation gonna be like at the wake? stefan j. is a writer living in vancouver. you can read his personal blog here and follow him on twitter here.         lebron, you're more than a basketball player you're a worldwide brand. jay z announced a new album in a damn samsung commercial. why can't you do the same thing? we want a commercial that people will voluntarily watch on youtube. we want them to press skip ad before literally watching a commercial. we want them to forget that it's a commercial at all, but, like, not to the point where they don't want to buy the product. that would be stupid. we want them to buy the product. sports commercials are filled with the same shit. they're black and white, they have dramatic music, slow motion and voice-overs. and they're all the same for a reason: because they work. why mess with the formula? anyway, here's the script. let us know what you think.    lebron (voice-over) all my life, i ve been underestimated. [black and white. we see a pair of hands grasping a basketball.] lebron (vo) like a metaphorical basketball being dropped to the ground. [the basketball drops to the ground, bounces a few times before finally rolling away.]  lebron (vo) the metaphorical basketball represents me or does it? maybe i'm the hands that dropped the ball. [the ball gets picked up by the hands, and then dropped again. remember that all of this is in black and white so it's really powerful.] lebron (vo) all my life, i ve been surrounded by haters. [we hear an angry crowd yelling at the hands holding the basketball. oh yeah, right, the hands picked the ball back up at some point, after dropping it for a second time. could the hands could they belong to lebron? the hands drop the ball again. we hear someone mumble shit.] lebron (vo) all my life, i've been told, you can t do that. [we see a close-up of someone wagging their finger angrily. it's a different hand, not the hands that keep dropping and picking up the basketball. we cut back to those hands and they're picking up the basketball that they just dropped, for, like, the fifth time.]  lebron (vo) guess what? i'm done being underestimated. [the hands start dribbling the basketball, doing cool tricks with the ball. once again, it needs to be stressed that this is all in black and white, so it's really artistic.] lebron (vo) i'm done with the haters. [the hands drop the ball, but this time, there's a reason. they flip the double bird, and the disembodied crowd gasps. insanely rude, but hey, sometimes people want attitude. maybe we'll throw in a guitar riff when he flips the birds. the guitar will emphasize the rudeness of the gesture.]  lebron (vo) i can do that. [we pull back and it turns out the hands holding the basketball did belong to lebron james. nobody saw this coming. lebron does an insane dunk and the crowd of haters literally catches on fire. it's unclear why this happens, or why lebron is training in a gym full of people who vocally detest him in the first place. lebron turns and faces us.] lebron i m ready to make my decision. [we flash back to the decision. it's in black and white, but a slightly lighter shade, to show that it's in the past. we see lebron making his decision in super slow-mo.] lebron but this time it's going to be different.  [lebron dribbles the ball and gives a little laugh. it's pleasant as hell.]  lebron this fall, i'm going to be playing world-class basketball in [insert city name here]. [lebron turns to leave and tosses the ball over his shoulder. the ball slowly comes to a stop, revealing the nike logo. wow. this creative tour-de-force was a fucking commercial?!]     anyway, we'll give you a few days to mull it over. just remember, every superstar athlete needs an iconic commercial. joe green had coca-cola. tiger had the one where he bounced the golf ball. jordan had the, uh, you know, the one where he had that stupid little mustache. the hitler underpants one, remember? lebron, it's time for your hitler underpants moment. stefan j. is a writer living in vancouver. you can read his personal blog here and follow him on twitter here.         if u meme it, they will come is a postmodern fable of likes and loss. like a classic greek tragedy, it will be told in three parts. this is where our story begins. he threw smoke. he always had. i didn t choose the meme life, he would say. the meme life chose me. he lived on tumblr clouds and in 9gag gutters. they say that when it was overcast, you could almost see imgur links and twitter screenshots coming out of his ears. memes made sense to patrick lauer the way constellations revealed themselves to the ancient astronomers. if you can see orion's belt, it's plain as day, but if no one points it out to you, you probably never will. @lauer_pauer could see orion's belt. he was copernicus, galileo, sir isaac fuccboi newton, speaking truth to power and defining an entire generation's moments of mobile happiness, one dank ass meme at a time. on the day he disappeared, lauer had over a billion followers on instagram, making him the internet's most powerful meme lord by far. yet, when he turned up again, he couldn't buy a like. orion's belt is just a cluster of stars, after all, and his is a story about stars that fade. act i: true af like most kids who grow up as an only child, patrick was a little weird. somewhere on the spectrum, is how his dad described it to neighborhood couples that his mother invited over for dinner. he was quiet. that was the first thing people noticed about him and often the only thing they remembered. in high school, he smoked weed in the woods behind the gym, paying with cash earned selling stolen ti-85s on ebay. that all changed when he found memes. seemingly overnight, @lauer_pauer took instagram by storm. a week after posting his first meme  a squinting beagle surrounded by empty pbr cans with text that read: i'm not drunk 'til i say i'm drunk, woman patrick's account had a million followers. a few days later when he uploaded a renaissance portrait of one cherub dancing while another fell down beside it (caption: when she ready to smash but ur 2 turnt), it had 10 million. all of a sudden, the morose teenager was a sensation. magazines called for interviews. where do you come up with this stuff, asked the reporters excitedly. how do you even think of it?! he'd smirk cordially, then tell them all about his creative process and his curation and the submissions from adoring fans that kept the @lauer_pauer furnace burning bright with an endless cavalcade of double-taps. they'd write it all down before racing back to their shared office spaces in open air lofts to tell the story about this kid. he speaks to the internet and it speaks back! screamed the headlines. meet the meme whisperer! when the brands saw the stories about @lauer_pauer, patrick's life changed again. agencies breathlessly begged him to take fantastic sums of money for even the most oblique #spon for their clients. influencer networks emailed blindly, pleading for the opportunity to represent him. everyone had budget for @lauer_pauer. they hardly had a choice. his microcontent was impeccable, original and utterly unrivaled. with 500 million instagram followers  including innumerable celebrities, several heads of state and every tenured anthropologist in the country and an undefeated reputation of capturing virality, it was inevitable what came next. patrick became obscenely rich. his life was restored from moderate delinquency to marvelous wealth by simple image macros. he never told his parents about the vast fortune memes had brought him. it was his secret. patrick was custodian of many unremarkable secrets, and one enormous one.  you're going to have to start paying for this yourself, his mom said as he walked out of the wireless store, holding his new iphone. he hefted the phone in his hands, savoring the matted finish. i'm serious, patrick, she continued, warily eying the distant expression on his face. i don't know what you're doing with these phones, but the next time you break one, it's coming out of your summer allowance. her constant nagging made his skin crawl and grit his teeth. patrick hated her unequivocally and without much basis, a hatred only teenagers can muster. he was 17, a senior in high school. i'll pay for it right now, he spat contemptuously, fishing a wad of bills out of his cargo shorts and leafing through them. what as it? six? seven hundred? i literally don't care. his mother was staring, not at him, but at the money. all hundreds. how much? hello? hello?! that evening, he sat at the top of the stairs and listened to his mother hysterically recount the event to his father. it has to be drugs, right? it has to be. i'm telling you, it must have been $3,000, right there in his hands. patrick smirked gleefully. he'd really only been carrying around a grand that day, but if she thought it looked like a lot, she'd have a fucking aneurysm to learn the actual size of his fortune. he wandered back to his room, still grinning. he turned the light on. the grin vanished with the darkness. in the corner of his bedroom stood an ancient man with glittering eyes and stark white hair. in one hand, he held a phone. les, patrick murmured. what are you doing here? hi, patrick, said les, flatly. he tapped the phone's screen. it's time to go.  the following morning, patrick's mother entered his room and found it empty. a flighty woman, she immediately fled down the stairs to call the police. her husband stopped her as she dialed. he's probably just acting out, he reasoned. a day later, patrick still hadn't returned, so they summoned the cops and together they all returned to the bedroom. there were no signs of struggle, said the officers. everything was in its right place, except for two curious items that neither of the lauers had ever seen before. the first was a stack of exactly 100 brand new iphones. each had an identical three-way crack across the screen. they were stashed in a drawer of his desk. later, the police would trace their serial numbers and discover that none of them had been reported stolen. in fact, none of them had appeared on retail shelves or on shipping manifests at all. no one knew what to make of it. the second thing they found in patrick's room was a rectangular sticker fixed to the inside of the drawer full of phones. it was red with plain white lettering. no one knew what to make of that, either.  stay tuned as our story will continue in act ii.

the wispy white brows over the older man's dark eyes moved upward in a mouthless grin. patrick stepped across the room to his desk. you're here for a piece? fine. he unlocked a drawer and slid it open. 100 iphones, each with the same three-way crack across the screen, stared up at him. patrick gestured to the drawer. bet you didn t think i'd keep these, huh? i'm not here for the hardware. no, you don't get it. these aren't just shitty phones. they're cold storage. bitcoin, off the network. this is where i keep it. here, said patrick, grabbing one and offering it to his lifeless guest for inspection. this has 10,000 bitcoin. every phone is. do you understand? i turned this shit into an empire. consulting projects, niche marketing gigs, international...i'll cut you in. les was wearing a dark double breasted suit with bone white buttons. he sighed, adjusting his lapels deliberately. i'm not here for the money, either. we don't need it. at the mention of we, the rancorous 'grammer grit his teeth involuntarily. what, then? why are you here? what the hell do you want?! patrick felt the bile rising in his throat. he was angry. what do you want, old man?!  for the first time in three years, he felt small and it infuriated him. he was @lauer_pauer, for fuck's sake! the untouchable #influencer. a timeline tycoon backed by an army of a billion followers. les tapped his phone again and calmly rebuffed the boy king's outburst, you knew this was coming. you agreed to the terms. fine. i get it. what about the token? suddenly, patrick wasn't shouting anymore. just as quickly as it arrived, his anger was gone. now his voice had turned soft, pleading, the token? you can have it back. that's the important part, right? he gestured to the rectangular crimson decal on the inside wall of the drawer. it's just a shitty meme anyway. take it. the white haired man in the double breasted suit was silent. his eyes glittered. take it back! patrick was screaming again, but this time, desperation, not indignation, was fanning the flames of his fury. where were his parents? couldn't they hear him? les sighed again, exasperated. he tapped his phone once more and spun around on the heel of his oxblood boot. his back was to the boy. that's not what the contract said. it's time to go, he said. now the phrase sounded like a chant, each word falling into place. staring at les' shoulders disbelievingly, patrick began to feel the room get smaller around him. he reached out for the desk, but it was so far away. he tried to pull out his phone, to open instagram, to send out a call from @lauer_pauer for help, but the brand new iphone, the one he'd bought earlier that day to spite his mother, felt like a lead weight in his pocket. he felt like he was falling, but les' shoulders never moved in front of him.  it's time to go. nothing is free. it's time to go. nothing is free. it's time to go. nothing is free, patrick. at the mention of his name, the kid opened his eyes. he was in a open floorplan room with high ceilings. sunshine poured through massive windowpanes at either end of the long space. massive tables stretched out in front of him like church pews. there were dozens of them, each perfectly parallel to the next. patrick peered curiously at the closest one, then recoiled like he'd been shocked by an invisible current. there, squarely in front of the desk chair, was an iphone. its screen bore a three-way crack. every table had rows of chairs. every chair had the same cracked phone in front of it. patrick swallowed hard. i told you we didn't need the hardware, les said quietly. the one-time don of the double-tap felt the hair rising on the back of his neck. he turned around. where are we? our offices. how did we get here? les shrugged and unbuttoned his suit. his hands were bony. they moved over the fabric with the awkward efficiency of a crab across sand. patrick tried again, why did you bring me here? this is where we settle our accounts. the time-worn figure nodded his snow white head to the room, as if to say, what do you think? patrick looked around. the place looked like a start-up. walls of exposed brick flanked long open spaces filled with the preferred accoutrement of the creative class. there was a bar, a ping pong table and a lounge area with bean bag chairs and couches. flatscreen tvs hung from cement pillars. patrick had been in this office plenty of times before, or, at least, ones just like it. account managers courted @lauer_pauer there. reporters scribbled notes and ripped selfies with him. marketing executives listened with rapt attention as he trolled them with ludicrous strategies for duplicating his success. les' office was just like any of those places, but for one fundamental difference: they were alone in the silence. there were no employees, no clickety-clacks from matte silver macs. so! you went for the money, les interjected, breaking the kid's trance. smart. you'd be surprised how many of our clients waste their time amassing power. much harder to hang onto afterward. all of a sudden, his face tightened unnaturally, revealing a stack of teeth as white as the hair on his head. a moment later, they were gone. was that a smile?  les carried on. for you, 'afterward' is what happens when you leave this office. do you understand? patrick remained silent. the content, the celebrity, it's all part of the deal, the old man finished the sentence with a shrug. what if i don't pay? patrick croaked sullenly. what if i fuck it all right now? what if i just delete @lauer_pauer? i could send it to the bottom, right now. then what? les cocked his wizened head to the side. that's right, you old fuck, snarled patrick, swelling with sudden confidence at the other's expression. you need me more than i need you now. you gave me the totem one shitty meme. i turned it into a brand. you don't know content. you don't understand memes. i take the internet's shit and turn it into posts that make a billion people laugh. you can't do that. you don't know how to do it. you're not even fucking on instagram. he spat the final sentence like a curse. no. no, this contract isn't over. you're going to extend it. you can't do this without me. otherwise, i'm not giving you shit. patrick's words lingered in the vacant air between them. the old man peered curiously at the internet's favorite son. their creation. their puppet prince of the pound sign. something like pity flickered across his face. you already have, patrick, he said quietly. what did you think the memes were? each time you added a caption, or cropped a photo, or paired the perfect .gif to its reaction, you transformed the content into your own creation? is that what you thought?  patrick blinked. who ever said that mattered? a meme isn't owned by the person who makes it. les' voice grew harder now. it's owned by the account who finds it and posts it to the biggest audience. where do you think those memes came from? all that fire content we gave you?  in the corner of his eye, patrick noticed a flash from the nearest tv. had it been on the whole time? he turned. the screens, mounted on the row of columns, were all lit up now, scrolling through instagram images from accounts he'd never seen before. he looked closer. why these pigeons look like they about to drop the most fire mixtape of 2015? demanded a photo of birds looking into a fisheye lens. another proclaimed kids these days don t know the struggle boldly over a picture of an anti-skip discman. u were prob too young to know but raymundo was high as shit said a third. a cartoon illustration of the chill dad from nickelodeon's rocket power lingered for a moment on the screen. the kid swallowed hard. they were all memes from other accounts, patrick. the accounts of the people who used to own these phones. they all had business with us. just. like. you. no, stammered patrick. i found a lot of those on my own. tumblr, 9gag, imgur...my fans sent them to me! didn't you ever wonder who these fans were, inboxing you with free content out of the goodness of their digital hearts? asked les. didn't it ever strike you as odd that the best macros on reddit always ended up in your hands weeks before they hit the front page? weren't you surprised at how effortlessly you picked up followers once you had the totem? do you really think you're that good? the sunlight that had drenched the office when they'd arrived was gone. outside, it was dusk. we gave them to you, les declared. we built you. the meme-whisperer! he talks to the internet and it talks back!  the old man adjusted his suit again. we enjoyed those headlines too, patrick. content really is crucial to telling a brand's story. why do you think we kept sending the reporters? the one-time cool teen  felt queasy. with a sweaty palm, he fumbled around for his phone. where is it? the folds of fabric seemed impossibly deep. @lauer_pauer was the perfect opportunity, les continued. the chance to consolidate reach with mobile users. the occasion to speak directly into the ear of youth culture. so, what's the point? patrick murmured, still digging for his phone. the point? the old man seemed delighted by the question. there's a battle going on, patrick. a war for the soul of the internet. followers are the only true currency left in the digital wasteland and we aim to keep it that way. people who read the news, or create their own content, or even slide into dms, they believe in the goodness of communication. les rolled his eyes. we believe in the truth: they who control the memes, control the followers, control the internet. we can't actually make instagram accounts. it's against the rules. but the followers are the ones we wanted you to bring us, so we spoke to them through the memes we sent to you. we don't need you any more than we need the totem or these phones, les said, sweeping his arm towards the tables. he watched patrick rummage through his pockets. we certainly don't need your phone. look at it, patrick. try to delete your account. go ahead. as if on cue, patrick finally latched onto his iphone and pulled it out. it sat in his palm, screen facing down. a new dread gripped him. flip it over, les invited dangerously. patrick did, and gasped. his phone, his new phone, was cracked in three. it'd been in his pocket the whole time. the kid who only threw smoke looked green as the floor began to spin beneath him. you can't stop the wheel from turning now that it turns against you. you signed up, kid. les was roaring now, his eyes blazing like black fire, his teeth gnashing. patrick cowered before him as his words thundered down. the lights flickered. you sold us your account to get rich and famous. you have. but now, it's time to cash out. your memes were our memes. your followers are our followers. you've delivered the soul of the internet to us and now we own it. the whole room was spinning rapidly now and patrick couldn't see the windows anymore. les' glittering obsidian orbs filled his view. it's time to go.  in the wee hours of the morning, wind whipped an old tabloid towards a bus stop on the outskirts of town. meet @lauer_pauer, king of content! it screamed. it was old news. these days, everyone just wanted to know where the king of content was. it'd been two weeks since the lauers filed a missing person report and police had no leads on patrick's disappearance. with a billion followers, @lauer_pauer sat dormant. the last photo was a picture of papa john. i love it when you call it me papa it said. the cops had questioned every local pizza place in the area, thinking the meme might have been a clue the kid left behind. nothing. the broadsheet tumbled past the bus stop, coming to an abrupt halt when it smacked into a solid object. the miniscule impact on his leg was enough to rouse patrick and he blinked himself awake. across the street was a strip mall. he recognized it. thank god. he reached for his phone to call someone. his parents, the police, anyone. it was still cracked. grimacing, he shoved it back into his pocket, stood up and set out in the direction of his house. the paper blew away and once again the bus stop stood empty in the pre-dawn darkness. above him, the sky hung blank and starless. stay tuned as our story will conclude in act iii.

who should we call? anxiety washed through the house, its waves lapping up against the closed door at the top of the stairs. upon stumbling back home early that morning, patrick had found his mother sitting listlessly in the kitchen. her eyes were red and bleary and she was smoking a cigarette. his appearance wracked her body with loud sobs that could be heard through the house. mr. lauer had been working in the backyard when he first heard his wife's outburst and came running. the past couple of weeks had been rough. by day, their house was a circus of strangers constant questions from new detectives, press conferences with the local news encouraging the community to call in tips about their missing sons whereabouts and so on. when night fell, they were left alone with the mounting dread of probability. two weeks is a long time for someone to be missing, but it's an even longer time for someone missing to turn up alive. hustling towards the sounds of mrs. lauer's distress, he had reason to expect the worst. that patrick was home, that was the good news. great news. the lauer family, whole again. the father clutched his son tightly for the first time in a decade. the mother wept happily. the son, instead of recoiling from these uncharacteristically genuine hysterics, stood listlessly at the center of them. @lauer_pauer, the prodigal son, was home. physically, at least. eventually, once mrs. lauer had stopped crying and her husband had taken up the phone to give word that the search was over, she worked up the courage to ask patrick, in the most conciliatory tones possible, if he was okay. had he been kidnapped? molested? raped? the suspense swelled in the sunny kitchen and her mind raced in anticipation of the grim tale she was about to hear. but none came. patrick said nothing. she asked again, and then again, her voice gradually mounting until she was screaming at the teen. are you ok?! are you ok?! the notes of panic pierced the air between them like firecrackers and fizzled as quickly. mr. lauer, watching from the other room, relayed the scene to the police on the line. this happens sometimes, ventured the detective uncertainly. he had the receiver of his desk phone pinned between his shoulder and his ear as he scrolled aimlessly through instagram on his cellphone. shock does weird shit to kids. ever since he started this case, he'd become hooked on the @lauer_pauer account and he went to it now. his thumb stopped its rhythmic flick at a picture of a pug dressed like a pirate with a caption that read arrrrrrr you fucking kidding me? the detective grinned silently and double-tapped the screen. whatever happened, he had to admit, the stuff the teen posted was funny. give him a little more time. for now, the kid who talked to the internet had fallen silent.  getting a new phone was easy. he ordered it online, blankly accepting a shipping surcharge in exchange for overnight delivery. mrs. lauer watched, baffled, as patrick padded mutely down the stairs to retrieve a package from the doorstep, then directly back up to his room. another cigarette burned low between her fingers. upstairs, patrick shut his bedroom door tightly, then opened the top drawer of his desk. the shattered screens jeered back at him, carving his reflection into shards. he placed his most recent device on top of the stack and closed the drawer without looking at the totem. bush did 9/11, it laughed as the desk shut. the new iphone was light in his hand as he swiped through his photo folders. when he found what he was looking for, an untitled album nested several layers beneath the surface of his camera roll, his fingers lingered over it for a moment, unsure. patrick grit his teeth and opened the folder, expecting...what? that les had plundered his treasure trove of microcontent? that they had all turned to dust? that this whole thing, the bitcoin, the celebrity, the meme life, was just a mirage that would go up in smoke now that the void had been touched? but there they were. all the meme-whisperer's treasured jpegs, exactly as he'd left them. not a pixel out of place. puppies acting like white girls, tfws, struggles only '90s kids remember. patrick scrolled faster, relief rising with each flick of his thumb. the folder was as bottomless as ever, a well of untold depths brimming with potential. his solace was soaring, but brief. @lauer_pauer hadn't posted anything in weeks. he had to start talking to the internet again, and fast. he rummaged through the folder for something to post, settling on a picture of kevin mccallister's mom with a surfer photoshopped into the curl of her hair as though it was a wave. perfect. with some care, patrick typed a caption. wavvvvvvvy, mon, wavvvvvvy. he paused, then tacked on a few wave emojis for good measure. mrs. mccallister got off to a strong start, clocking 11 likes in just a few seconds, and a hundred soon after that. patrick, feeling each minute more like himself, set about examining his old phones. he turned one over in his hands, hunting for a sign of tampering, a clue, something. how had les put cracks in the phones? he fretted over it for another few minutes, then turned his attention back to instagram. the orange notification bar at the bottom of the screen announced the performance of the photo and for the first time he could remember, patrick wondered about how a post was doing. when the alert registered, he frowned. 5,000 comments, but only 100 likes? that never happened. he went back to mrs. mccallister and scrolled down. his heart plunged. plagiarist, the commenters screamed in block caps. hack! he gulped. you're a no-talent piece of shit. way to rip off people who are actually funny, asshole. the farther down he scrolled, the more bitter the vitriol became. fuck this account. unfollowed!!! a commenter had doxxed him, posting his home address right there in public for anyone to see. another posted a gun emoji, seemingly in response. smdh already seen like 10 times!!!! lame af!!! unnerved, patrick closed the app and put down his phone. his palms were sweating again. his followers never said stuff like that. they just tagged their friends and exclaimed how us or same a particular meme was. anger in the realm was something new and unfamiliar for the king of content. you should see what they're saying about you on twitter. patrick turned around to find les staring at him. the old man stood straight as a rod, eyes glittering. he wore a dark suit and a curt, thin-lipped smile. seems as though another account posted mrs. mccallister a few months ago. shame. les took a step towards patrick. i didn t know that, the teen said quietly. i just found it online, like always. we sent it to you, like always, les corrected him gently. but we sent it to someone else first.  still staring, he gestured to patrick's phone. the kid glanced at the screen, which was now full of frenzied headlines. @lauer_pauer: content thief screamed one. the meme-whisperer disgraced! proclaimed another. a third invited readers to meet the worst person on the internet and ran alongside a split image of the mccallister meme and patrick's face. i warned you that this would happen, said les. it would have been wiser to fade away. less painful. he sighed. the memes are ours, patrick. you got the internet hooked on them for us. now it's time for to step aside. we have a new account that we're backing. new blood, younger audience. take a look. les gestured to patrick's phone. an instagram feed had appeared on the screen. it looked like his, exactly like his, right down to the business inquiries email listed in the bio. @toiletpizza: laugh so hard, you'll shit yourself, read the note next to it. patrick grimaced. he'd never even heard of this account before and it already had 500 million followers. it's amazing, isn't it? they don't care that @toiletpizza didn't make the meme. they don't care that you wrote a caption, and he didn't. they don't care! les' voice practically bounded with delight. they just want to consume it. more of it, always more, and every double tap without the toxic guilt of supporting the known thief @lauer_pauer. but everyone reposts stuff, patrick protested. he stole it from someone too! but he reposted it first, les shrugged. we've been keeping our new investment well-stocked and out of trouble, for now. but let's talk about you. you have a choice. we still need memes and you know how to make them. we're willing to let you continue posting under two conditions. patrick looked up tentatively. les raised his hand to shoulder height, a single bony digit extended towards the ceiling. one: you have to make your own memes now. create new ones, not just add captions. we need more grist for the mill. patrick stared guardedly, but said nothing. he allowed himself the slightest hope. that's not so bad. with an account of my size, i should probably be doing that anyway. les raised another finger. two: no more instagram. you may post your content on twitter, and twitter only. what?! are you fucking kidding me?!  patrick's hope immediately turned to horror. no one's on twitter. i don't even have any followers there. this is a death sentence! les shrugged again. someone has to make the memes, patrick. you've enjoyed the throne, now it's your turn in the trenches. we can't have you cluttering the instagram lane for our other interests. no! this is bullshit! i won't do it! @lauer_pauer is over on instagram, patrick, les said. his voice was hard again, his eyes flashing. this is not up for negotiation. post to the account if you want, but the backlash will only get worse. do you want more people doxxing you, showing up to your house, terrorizing your family? trolls are a lot scarier when they're knocking at your door. the threat hung heavy in the air for a moment before les dismissed it with an affable flick of his wrist. if you churn out memes for us on twitter, everything will be fine. you can do it with your @lauer_pauer handle if you'd like. and if the content is really good, we may even give you a credit. you and you alone have the chance to keep your brand alive. ignore it  he pursed his lips as though lost in thought, then locked eyes with patrick, and you'll disappear completely. les buttoned his suit and fixed his tie. either way, this is the last time we will speak, he said. what you do from here is up to you. as we upheld our bargain with you, we will protect @toiletpizza now. join us and your personal brand can live on in a different form. defy us and we'll fucking destroy you. he walked across the room towards patrick, who was now standing in a daze. as the old man approached, he shrunk back in fear, but les passed by the boy and approached the desk. he opened the drawer full of phones and turned back around. goodbye, patrick. with that, the grey-haired man gently peeled the totem off the wood panel. bush did 9/11 sneered at the cool teen. les produced a strip of wax paper from inside his jacket and stuck the red sticker to it. then, grinning wickedly, he tucked it into his breast pocket like a handkerchief and promptly disappeared forever.  patrick came out swinging. in the days that followed, he never left his room, posting a dizzying stream of fire memes in an attempt to win his audience back. he wrote captions and tagged other accounts. he started giving credit whenever he could track down the almost impossible to locate genesis of a particular meme. it didn't matter. nothing worked. his account hemorrhaged its influence with each passing day. the followers left @lauer_pauer in two ways: angrily, with a deliberate fuck you left in the comments or aimlessly, stumbling away as though from a bar at last call when the lights have come up and the after-party beckons. the empire, once a vast, constantly-updated hydra of macros and screencaps that damn blotted out the sun, tumbled into a state of disrepair. with no one to lead it, his army of a billion followers wandered into the ether. he even tried to make a go of it on twitter with the hope that he could rebuild there. the timeline was a fickle beast with its own rules, ones patrick never quite got the hang of. he was always behind on the news or missing a piece of the joke. when he did nail a meme, it got a few dozen retweets before it was plucked from his feed and parroted by a million accounts across social media. of course, like clockwork, the meme would eventually turn up on @toiletpizza, where it would be celebrated as another piece of origin-less comedic genius. it was a hollow feeling. patrick lauer had charted the internet s heavens for the last time and he knew it. on a cloudy morning in the early fall, wracked with disgrace and bruised by vicious abuse, the internet's once great meme lord deleted all of his accounts. no one missed them. no one even noticed. coda he started speaking again, at first to his parents, who nearly collapsed with relief at the sound of his first words, then to a few of his classmates, then to people on the street. he started to develop relationships and social skills. mr. lauer stopped telling people patrick was on the spectrum, watching with disbelief and no small amount of pride as his son's behavior crept ever closer to that of a normal teenager. on his way out of the local bank, where he'd astonished the teller with a duffel bag full of cash recently converted from bitcoin for deposit, a newspaper vending machine caught his eye. through its plexiglass window, the front page of the paper screamed its headline: meet @toiletpizza, the wunderkind of content! patrick stared at it sadly for a moment and was about to carry on when a flash of red caught his eye. he stepped closer to the machine. there, on its side, as though it had been there forever, was a sticker.

i don't know. what i do know is that, much like that first girlfriend, i'm beside myself with grief because now i know for sure that my idea for a ski resort music video set in colorado that would have accompanied rich gang's undeniable sleeper cut, i know it, will now truly never materialize. so, instead, here it is, or rather, what it would have been. one certainly cannot precisely account for the kinds of improvisational gems young thug would have brought to the table during the actual filming. below are my sacred, untouched ideas, down to the color of quan's turtleneck. this is rich gang's i know it, a proposed music video treatment: aspen, colorado (afternoon) 0:00-0:20 fade in. camera pans slowly across a dense, mountainous landscape. the beat comes in, and rich homie quan's verse begins, but the camera is still just panning over snow and trees, until finally it reaches a log cabin. 0:20-0:30 the camera is led inside of the cabin wherein rich homie quan is seated, drinking a mug of hot chocolate (swiss miss marshmallow lovers for potential sponsorship opportunities) by a fireplace, wearing a black turtleneck, reading his favorite james patterson novel. his verse is playing, but he's not lip-syncing, he's just reading his book and sipping his hot chocolate. at the moment when his line i ain't hit it in front of your children. haa. i'm lying comes in, he looks up at the camera briefly and mouths the words i'm lying, as they occur, then his eyes dart back to the book. 0:30-0:40 he lodges a bookmark at his current spot, puts the book down, but continues to carry his cup of hot chocolate. he puts on louis vuitton earmuffs and begins to walk outside. the camera follows him. 0:40-1:10 quan walks outside to reveal a number of women making snow angels in his front yard, all in unison. they're all wearing missy elliott the rain (supa dupa fly) level black bubble ski jackets and gucci goggles. 1:10-1:30 quan motions toward one of them and a flawless snow angel is revealed beneath her as she gets up. she walks beside him. he's still sipping his hot chocolate. the camera pans out to reveal a moving chairlift and the pair gets into one of the chairs. 1:30-2:00 the chairlift jerks them forward and the girl lip-syncs the rest of quan's verse as they move up the mountain, while he casually and silently sips his hot chocolate, making eye contact with neither the camera nor the rapping girl beside him. 2:00-2:40 quan gets off the chairlift on a serene plateau, to the extended dap/embrace of young thug, who sports a hawk on his right shoulder. there are also a number of women gathered around a campfire, putting together and eating s'mores in a rhythmic, assembly line fashion. they're all wearing black ski jackets, gucci goggles and wooden snowshoes. they're rapping thug's verse, but he is not. 2:40-3:10 the camera pans out to reveal birdman seated beside an elaborate looking, possibly steampunk-influenced (there is steam emanating from it) money counter. he appears to be loading up a bag with stacks of hundred dollar bills. the camera then pans out to reveal that the bag sits on a sled. the camera pans out once more (this time with a distinctly more dramatic abruptness) to reveal that it is a dog sled, the front of which is attached to a pack of vicious huskies, the reins of which are being held back by the strenuous-looking pull of a fully-furred london on da track. 3:10-3:50 birdman, looking satisfied, nods his head toward london on da track, who takes that as the official cue to release the dog sled. birdman clasps his hands (as the final rich gang tag comes in) together and rubs them, characteristically. the camera then follows the dog sled as it runs in the snow, away from the group. it then pans out, slowly, mirroring its fluid entrance, as the dogs get smaller and the landscape fully re-emerges. young thug's hawk flies by. fade out. alex russell doesn't know shit about how music video treatments actually work. he is a human living in new york city. follow him on twitter here.         it's wednesday night in february and i'm dying for a cigarette. the coat check girl has been talking at me for the last 10 seconds, but 6 god came on as soon as she opened her mouth, so i haven't heard a single word. bangerrrrrrr, i yell, making praying hands at the dj. no one around me is paying attention. this dude does a good job at these brand parties. i've seen him out here for years. fuck is his name?  i said, i have to get your ticket! do you have it? oh right. coat shit. cigarette shit. she'd actually be pretty cute if she wasn't rocking bitch face at me from inside a closet full of wack outerwear. i grin widely, working the charm. i just had it! i'm telling her. it fell out of my pocket over there! i'm pointing vaguely to the other side of the studio, where i was instagramming things for paige. i'm not sure if it's true, but who cares? i promise i won't steal a struggle snorkel, i explain, laughing broadly. her made-up face is clammy with sweat and offers little reaction. i'm not allowed to! she's yelling at me again. i can't! i'm about to just push by her, but i trip and fall into her table. the crowd, all at once sensing that my time is up, presses against me en masse. i'm borne off by a current of bodies holding free cocktails in plastic cups. i go with the flow and wind up back in the middle of the event, kind of tight, but also fine with it. paige will get this sorted. then i'll get a cigarette. on my way to the open bar, i realize i've got a vape pen in my back pocket. i'm not sure what's in it. close enough. the bartender looks like this part-time guy from freeman's that i used to party with, but it's not him. what was that guy's name? when the bartender finally glances towards me, i'm in the middle of a drag and he gives me a weird look. i finish the hit anyway and ask for a vodka rocks and a beer. he leans across the table. i'm only supposed to do one drink per, bud. but the vodka is for my girl! she's in the bathroom. he stands back, sizing me up. i can tell he doesn't want to give me what i ordered. dude, it's fine, i assure him. her name is paige! she's running this whole event! his face is still uncertain, but after a moment he decides it's not worth the trouble, hands me a heineken and starts pouring clear liquor into a clear cup. i've already turned my back and downed the mixed drink before i remember that i left my vaporizer on the bar. whatever. they'll send me another. ferg's voice is barking work from the speakers and the crowd is turning up, full of bouncing faces screwed into masks of effort. smiling to myself, i upend my heineken and lurch off into the abyss to find paige. i'm halfway through the crowd when, eyes focused on my skyward beer bottle, i run straight into something. a waiter is sprawled in front of me, his appetizer tray strewn all over ground beside him. c'mon, man! the waiter is on the floor and pissed off. i go to help him up, but i'm off-balance and fall down next to him. i am the life of this party.  look out! i'm cracking up. someone instagram me down here with fam! i throw my arm around the guy and reach for my phone with my other hand. when i turn back, there's a red stain spreading across the crisp white sleeve of his uniform. ketchup from his tray, probably. i'm dying laughing and looking for someone who will take my phone to snap a photo of me and this fucking waiter covered in ketchup on the floor at paige's event. yo! yo! you're fucking bleeding dude! get off me! the waiter is scrambling away from me now, his sleeve now totally crimson and i don't understand what he's talking about until i see the light glinting off the shards of heineken bottle embedded in my palm. i'm cackling like a guy who built a brand out of a tumblr dashboard, who's been to a thousand brand parties that were a thousand times better than this. who can't be stopped by a flesh wound. who hasn't a care in the world. i am the life of every party.  i don't know how long she's been standing behind me. i don t know how long i've been here, or how long i've been coming to her parties. i do remember the first time i met her. another waiter hands me a dishrag for my hand and helps his coworker up. i pull myself into a sitting position and start picking the bottle out of my palm. it barely hurts and i'm still laughing. people surge around the bloodied bon vivant on the ground. for a moment, i recognize them, but then their bobbing faces get nearer and i don't. who are these kids? paige has been inviting me to events for years. i know everyone in the scene. i cut the surgery short, hop up and make for the back bar. the crowd is thick and it's harder than ever to slip through, but i eventually cover the ground. if there's ever been a time for a drink, it's now, i say, smiling gamely to the girl behind the bar and nodding at my hand. my breath is short and hard, like i ran here from across town. i wonder idly if i had. how did i get to this bar? sir, are you ok? what happened? do you know paige? she's my sister it's her event some dude was harassing her and  i trail off, worried more about the bartender's reaction to my story than actually finishing it. she seems sympathetic. can i have a couple vodka tonics? uh, i  i know, i know. one per person. but can you j  the bartender's eyes look past me, then flick downard. a new voice cuts in from the place where she was looking and i turn around to greet it. what are you doing here? it's paige. i don't know how long she's been standing behind me. i don t know how long i've been here, or how long i've been coming to her parties. i do remember the first time i met her. it was at another brand party at another event space (the whole city, the whole world is full of brand parties, all exactly the same) and i was there because everyone needed me there, paige most of all. what are you doing here, michael? her voice is harder now, narrow and probing. i look to the bartender, hoping for even a single vodka, but she's miles away from us at the other end of the bar. what a shitshow. my stomach churns and i wonder what time i started drinking today. the room is crawling. over paige's shoulder, the faces are bouncing faster than before. i wanted a smoke, but they wouldn't let me  there's a new song playing that i don't recognize. the unfamiliar bass drowns out my words and, for the first time tonight, i wish this fucking dj would turn the music down. fuck is his name?  the waiter ran into me over there and i fell. i reach for my phone to show her the instagram, but it's not in my pocket. when i look back up, paige's face is bobbing up and down too. i need a drink, but she won't give me... i'm on the floor again and i don't know how i got there. paige is looking down at me from a great height. she looks so sad. i laugh to show her it's no big deal. as i try to get up, my arms give out, so i laugh harder. her face is floating on the current of bodies holding free cocktails and i am deep beneath the surface. my hand is throbbing and my stomach is churning. when did i start drinking? i laugh harder and harder until the faces have all run together and drifted past. and then i start to cry. dave infante is a writer living in new york city. read more of his work on thrillist and follow him on twitter here.         this shit has gone on wayyy too long. i played it cool, but i finally reached my breaking point thanks to all this treasonous bullshit. editors have been talking mad reckless like they actually know what's hot in the streets. it would have been totally fine if you guys had kept playing menswear in your little fantasy land by yourselves, but then you went and made things personal. if you fire shots across my bow expect some to be returned. i'm black square-toed shoes and i'm here to fuck shit up. first off, some shout outs. shout out to gq, you fucking tool bitches. and fuck you too, esquire. and don't even think i'm going to take the time to name check the rest of you dicks in the circle jerk. you've been printing slander since jump street. say no to square toed shoes. upgrade your shoe game. new study links black square-toed shoes with asperger's. you asswipes need a new hobby. see, black goes with everything. i'm sleek and sexy at night. i m flossy and glossy in daylight. semi-formal?

yet, what if it were true? would that be the most bizarre fashion conspiracy of all time? oh no, my friends. it would not be. steve dool is a writer based in new york city. follow him on twitter.         the internet is a digital dystopia filled with rehashed jokes, vicious subtweets and dank ass memes. it's an online wasteland filled with predatory beasts and barren landscapes. there are no laws. there are no gods. there is only klout. there is only influence. a daily battle rages amongst the social media tastemakers to see who can reach the top of klout mountain first and plant their brand's flag the fastest. who will be the quickest to turn this momentary blip of pop culture into consumable content to satisfy the thirst of their loyal following? who will be timely enough to further establish themselves as important online by continuously crafting nuggets of word vomit in hopes it will turn into tangible rewards? there can only be one. along the way, you begin to lose a part of yourself. as more and more time passes, your voice begins to fade and you begin to use commonly established vernacular to fit in with your peers. you're no longer an individual. you've become a cog in the zeitgeist. you yearn for validation from strangers you may never meet. i've never said 'lit' in real life. why am i saying it online? you ask yourself. you begin to have a breakdown. who am i? is this me or is this all a character? you splutter between sobs. you no longer know if you're health goth or sport goth or fitness goth or only wears gym clothes to give off a perception of being fit and active when really you're just a lazy piece oof shit goth. fear not, my sweet child, the most problematic writer on four pins is here to help you. i've put together a handy list of the different types of goths you can be to help you through your freshly minted identity crisis. one day, everyone online will know their goth. alex hancock is a writer living in the future so the present is his past, but really he's in indianapolis. follow his problematic twitter here.         he took a short drag of his cigarette. tenderly, like a first sip of coffee when it's kicking off steam. a, b, c, he said. always. be. closing. like glengarry glen ross, fam. doesn't everyone die at the end of that shit? dunno. never saw the whole thing. just youtube. he shrugged and looked down at his phone. the unblinking retina stared back at him with a parade of tweets. drag. breathe.  do you have the money? he was holding a box in the crook of his arm with the particular loose-tightness of a running back. the box was burnt orange. nike, shouted the bold, white block type peeking out from beneath his tricep. yep, $150. right here. dawg, it's $175. i told you on instagram. well, i got $150. drag. exhale. he squinted. the kid wasn't a day older than 17, too soft and too clean. like growing up with central air. he ashed his cigarette and swiped through his phone, small-motor habits borne from years of doing things precisely the same way. why change now? fuck outta here. oh, you don't want the money? what happened to 'a, b, c'? he smirked. johnnie suburbs wants his sneakers.  who knows? i never saw the whole thing. just youtube. he was down to the filter. he flicked the cigarette to his feet, snuffed it beneath the heel of his coke whatevers and turned up the street. the white block letters scowled at the jilted adolescent in his wake. nike, they whispered from the crook of his arm.  before instagram, it was twitter. before them both, it was forums. but long before he found a marketplace full of like-minded people, or even imagined that there could be one, he was just a kid begging his mom to take him to foot locker. the ritual was always the same: while she asked the zebra-striped salesperson what was on sale, he wandered through canyons, peering skyward at walls made of colorful leather and smooth rubber. he saved the jordans for last, carefully averting his eyes from that holy corner until it was time, allowing the thrill to build with clerical willpower. the smell was intoxicating. in a childhood checkered with happy moments, that aroma of cowhide and fresh polymer was perhaps the finest. he grew up. slowly at first, then all at once. he got a fake id that said he was 18 and bought cigarettes for his high school friends. he charged them a premium and bought sneakers with the profits. his mom thought he was dealing weed and he enjoyed this fiction. he didn't enjoy the fights. they quarreled constantly mother and son, father and son, mother and father. after they screamed, they made up profusely, lobbing extravagant apologies into a deepening pool of dreaded certainty. his collection grew. despite the mounting distress, they were proud of him. why not? after high school, he went to college and graduated with a decent gpa and student debt to his name. he got a salaried office job. he didn't do drugs and drank in moderation. his vice was manageable and even at their most distraught, his parents admired the obsessive passion with which he pursued it. he moved out a few weeks before his 23rd birthday in a hail of hugs, handshakes and tears. in six months they were separated, his father in a condo across town with smooth granite countertops and a gas fireplace, his mother trapped in a house furnished for three. he didn't keep in touch with the people he knew in high school or college, so there wasn't much reason to go home. he stopped speaking with his parents too, except on holidays. one phone call, then another. by then, his friends were a loose flock of paypal accounts, twitter handles and numbers he texted on the eve of a big release. you got me? i got you. buy two, one to wear and one to flip. ship to europe. receive from japan. repeat. he spent his time in front of a glowing screen, reading bits of code and taking comfort in knowing their various meanings. htm. qs. nib. bred. iso. ds. he hadn't been inside a foot locker in years. gr. smfh.  one weekend, he came back home from his apartment to retrieve the remainder of his collection: three shelves of premium leathers, gum soles, rope laces, plus a towering stack of jordans. his mother looked older and he wondered if she knew he was only there because his old pairs were fire and he already had buyers. loading his car, he felt her watching him from the kitchen window. he shivered with the chill of a nameless guilt and slammed the trunk shut. he felt older too. on the drive back to the city, he glanced into his rearview mirror at the neatly stacked shoeboxes and began to cry.  after parting ways with johnnie suburbs, he wandered the streets for a while smoking cigarettes. when the sun set, the cold rolled in. he flipped up his collar and headed back to his apartment, where he returned the burnt orange box to an empty slot between two others just like it. nike, the letters croaked drowsily as he slid them back into place. his phone buzzed in his pocket. text? dm? low battery? it buzzed again, longer this time. phone call.  with one fluid, involuntary motion, the phone was out of his pants and into his sightline. mom, warned the screen. he froze. the walls of his apartment soared skyward, lined with the finest sneakers money could buy. he didn't have to save the jordans for last any more. he got them first. he got them all. grabbing the nearest burnt orange box, he opened it an inhaled deeply through his nose. he smelled the stink of cigarettes on his hands. he looked back at his phone. missed call, it whispered gravely. he slumped onto his couch and smiled grimly to himself. everyone dies at the end of everything, he reasoned bravely. then, he rapped the space bar on his laptop and pulled up the forums. dave infante is a writer living in new york city. read more of his work on thrillist and follow him on twitter here.         a few weeks ago, i was in nyc for my other kind of work when, the night i was supposed to jet out, a snow storm hit, bringing with it an extra day grounded on the fair isle of manhattan. i woke up that next morning, kissed my bowery bear good morning and looked at the internet on my phone until it led me to the complex office elevators to surprise my old college friend and current editor, larry schlossman (and not at all because i wanted to meet the kangaroo court of atlanta aka migos or, really, whomever). but the guy manning the key that unlocks levels of the building's elevators didn't give me a pass or a floor number, so i got stuck riding it up and down like a dumbwaiter in a house full of picky eaters. and because the complex elevators are lined with lead to scramble insurgent comms, my larry-bound lmao sos fam distress dms failed to send. these are the things i overheard during my hour-long joyride: a formula for when a hypebeast at an industry party asks you to guess how much his sneakers cost: take how old he looks, drink 3 comped bubblies, look at his shoes twice, save your eyerolls for the retelling and just say fifty bucks.  a: finally got one of those exercise ball chairs. b: you feel any different? a: like i'm way better than the rest of you.  so lemme get this straight. 'camera ready' equals hot? 'between movies' equals not hot? 'crumpleface' equals ugly crying?   a: visited my parents' new place in iowa this weekend. b: and? a: that place has a million people and, like, a dozen last names.  brooooo, just had a tattoo idea: latitude and longitude of where you first heard yeezus.  a: i'm supposed to hit the polo bar later tonight. b: heard that place'll gut you, fam. a: nah, they've had a price cut since opening, which means the owners will only get to race ponies instead of unicorns, and that shows real sacrifice.  a: drake says the first million is the hardest. b: pfft. first million what, fuccboi? a:   b:   a: first million times you get called 'fuccboi.'  look, i didn't mean to have so much fur in my 'grams. it just happened that way.  a: peep this pickup line you need to try. b: okay? a inching his finger toward b's right eye. just before contact, b shuts right eyelid. a: ayyy girl, did you just wink at me?  clothes don't make you happy. i now have 6 bombers and was just as happy when i had 5 bombers.  my parents are in town and scooping me up for lunch today so i bought a bonsai tree. nothing says you're in control of your life quite like a bonsai tree on your desk.  i wanna be as lit as you are when i grow up. or when you grow up, whichever happens first.  my little cape verdean grandfather would point at his left fist and whisper 'hospital,' then point to his right fist and whisper 'cementerio' and start laughing. he was so little!  if you ever think no one cares you're alive, try missing a couple student loan payments.  a finishing a joke i couldn't quite hear. b: i don't get it. a: if by 'it' you mean my respect, then yes.  ralph doesn't do what ralph does for ralph. ralph does what ralph does because ralph is ralph.  cute girl gets on elevator, rides 3 floors, then gets off. a: whoops. fell in love. me:   a: heh. [photo via shuttershock] rick morrison is a writer living in north carolina. follow him on twitter here.         if you're looking to indulge in some good old fashioned celebrity schadenfreude, tara reid's twitter isn't a bad place to start. i'll admit that when i first followed tara, that's exactly what i was looking for, and she does not disappoint. tara reid tweets like nobody's reading, including possibly her. most of her thoughts seem to travel on an express train directly to her fingertips, making no local stops at coherence or context or even spell check. punctuation does not exist in taradise, nor does any evidence of self-censoring or filtering out the most benign feelings she encounters within. take for instance, this tweet, posted at 2:47pm on november 3: just came back fe eating the best breakfast burrito ever! ignore the fact that from is misspelled and that she ate a breakfast burrito at 2:47pm on a monday, it's still the work of someone with a compulsion to share, even if that means sharing the least consequential information about the least significant topics. what made the breakfast burrito so great? where did she get said breakfast burrito? can we at least see a photo of it? who knows, unclear and no, you cannot. tara reid just wanted you to know that she ate a great goddamn breakfast burrito and now she's back. full stop. end scene. that total lack of filter has a certain appeal. no, it's not a peek inside her world, like you might get from other celebrities on twitter. it ' a peek inside her brain. you can laugh with her. you can cry with her. you can even invest with her. you can also talk with her, or at least at her, and be pretty sure she's listening. tara regularly interacts with her followers and seems to have a knee-jerk reaction to retweeting anyone who mentions her username, even when it's somewhat alarming. in that way, following tara reid on twitter is also an up close and personal look at the very vocal, very affectionate and very loyal fanbase she's amassed over the course of her career. who exactly is a self-professed tara reid fan in 2014? it's a good question to pose some 15 years after american pie was released. let's be honest, while the ironic popularity of sharknado may have thrust her back to the fringes of pop culture relevance, in the time between now and when she was riding high off of the success of american pie, she's mostly been known for obliviously exposing herself on diddy's red carpet, starring in one of the most cringe-inducing tmz videos of all time and the spectacular booze-addled disaster that was her e! series taradise. she's a long way from lebowski. and yet, there are her fans, lining up to wish her a happy birthday with intensely personal proclamations of love and generally showering her with praise. it's easy to guess how tara benefits from the love of her fans, a range of possibilities from the cynical a self-esteem boost for a needy actress past her prime to the optimistic genuine gratitude for those who ve stuck by her when the going got straight up unwatchable. but what do her fans get out of it, and what do they see in tara that explains their adoration? i had to ask. i reached out to a group of her most vocal supporters on twitter and four agreed to talk to me about why they love tara reid. their feelings were so sincere that i almost felt bad about following her for such snarky reasons. luckily for me, tara's god is not a vengeful one. as you can see in my dm sessions with tara s biggest fans on twitter above, it's the love for her fans, or at least the illusion of love, that goes a long way for her. for all of the things that tara does wrong, like spell words, she's definitely doing some things right. steve dool is a writer

familiarity with brushed leather uppers and apollo mission-grade rubber soles. the fbt debuted over a decade ago and was at once timeless and ahead of its time less a pastiche of native american moccasins than a futuristic tribute twined neatly around its own maypole, all buttoned up and breezy. the man behind the indigo-dyed curtain is one hiroki nakamura. his still-deep enthusiasm conjures thoughts of a sensei-cum-creative-director, or a shaggy, male red panda in a state of must, or a warrior monk whose artistic verve couldn't be contained by monastery walls, the way fr ulein maria's artistic verve couldn't be contained by monastery walls. in peeling away the singularly outr  design elements splayed across dozens of hiroki s finest fbt nuggets, the fully exposed provenance of the silhouette swirls underfoot the north america once belonging to roaming bison, peace pipes, porcupine needle work, maize, the sound of a kodiak bear ambling out of the water. once you get the ghostly-stoic hiroki talking and he senses he's got room to run, the man will wax philosophic about shoes until the casket drops. what a crazy notion in a world at war! according to hiroki, authentic moccasins are cut from a single piece of deer or elk leather, comprising both the upper and outsole material, and is typically stitched above the instep (referred to as a gathered toe) and down the heel with sinew. this authenticity is cross-hatched by the presence of a rubber instep, more suitable for urban-dwelling than the embryonic, soft-bottomed moccasins conceived to traverse soft knolls and leaf cover. the ankle flaps sometimes a single skirt, sometimes with fringe seen on the fbt register as superfluous, but actually flip up and tie around the ankle for additional warmth. it sounds like a throwaway feature, but in practice looks just as suitable worn while keeping to yourself on the g train as they would being attacked by a wampa whilst riding your tauntaun across hoth. it may

household objects at another person's head during a fight. folks have put down their fists and picked up shovels and scooters and other common items they have lying around their homes. these videos combines all the things that people love: objects being thrown at heads and heads being hit by objects. no one who watches one of these video is particularly concerned with the well-being of the victim who just had their occipital lobe caved in because they re too busy hooting and hollering and running around in excitement. and why should they show a sliver of empathy? or, hell, even sympathy? it's not them getting smacked in the face with something, so who gives a shit? it's a dog eat dog world and if one dog arms itself with a quasi-weapon, then too bad for the other dog. the unarmed dog should have ran away as soon as they heard some observing, third party instigator yell, worldstar! so that's on them. they had to have known what was coming. they deserve the brain damage.

students who somehow manage to have thousands of dollars to spend despite the fact that they should be broke college students, it's an excuse to go to a tropical paradise and party all the time. usually after their floridian excursion, these people light up facebook with hundreds of pictures of them in bathing suits. during the vacation, they are constantly posting on twitter and instagram about how great a goddamn time they are having. i'm having just as fine of a at my home in suburban new jersey, but you don t see me accosting every person i see, telling them about how many jellybeans i ate today (13). there is definitely pressure to make it seem like you are having a cool spring break while on spring break that, quite frankly, i'm sick of. if you aren't going to florida or mexico, don't sweat it. it's okay. put the cyanide pill down, you're going to live. i mean it. put the pill down and i'll tell you how to make it seem like you're having a wonderful spring break on social media, the gladiator ring of our time. please put it down, so i can start my tips. please? for me? put it down. super! here are my day-by-day tips. hey, wait. don't pick that back up. put it down. super! okay, and now back down again. down. down. down. great! if you're just hanging around your house during spring break and feel like a chump, here are some tips to make it seem like you had a rad time on social media. brendan o'hare is attempting to be a writer and comedian while living in nyc. follow his comedy jokes on twitter here.         congratulations! you are the new owner of a planet hollywood jacket! whether you bought the leather, varsity or denim style, you have made a choice that will impact the rest of your life for the better, we hope! the planet hollywood family is honored to have you showcase our restaurant on your person. just in case this is your first planet hollywood jacket (we hope it is the first of many, should you decide that is the type of person you want to be), we have enclosed our owner's guide of dos and don'ts. we know you may be thinking, i bought this jacket out of my own volition. i can make decisions for myself. why would i listen to you? first off, calm down! secondly, at almost $300, this is a big investment, so we want to make sure you get the most out of your jacket. we also want to make sure you avoid doing anything that may besmirch the planet hollywood name. planet hollywood has had a rough decade or so (but things are looking up), so we want to make sure that every necessary precaution is taken to ensure our degradation is not furthered. the jacket serves as an advertisement for our restaurant (of which there are four nationwide), and, although we assume you'll do nothing that makes planet hollywood look bad, we need to make sure we are fully protecting ourselves because there are some bad apples out there (we assume you aren't one). so, give this a quick read (well, not too quick haha) before putting on your new jacket. enjoy! don't: wear the jacket to planet hollywood from a purely fashion standpoint, this is a bit gauche. you are already at planet hollywood, so there's really no need for you to wear it here. you aren't going to convince anyone to come to planet hollywood because they're already here! we've no, they've already won. maybe wear a blazer or something a bit nicer. not that planet hollywood isn't nice (we would never say that, obviously), but a leather/varsity/denim jacket isn't exactly proper dining wear. you know this. we won't turn you away, but, like, it'll seem like we did, if that makes sense. now, to solve this problem, we are hard at work on a planet hollywood dinner jacket, but the technology is still a couple of years away. you probably won't be able to wear that at our restaurant either, but you might be. do: wear a long-sleeved shirt under the jacket the jacket has been known to have less than favorable reactions to those of us who have skin (which is all of us haha), so although you may want the leather/varsity/denim material pressing up against your longing skin, it is in your best interest to put on a thick long-sleeve shirt. we aren't saying you need to put on a full-on wool sweater or anything, but maybe something similar just in case. also, when putting on the jacket, wear gloves to make sure the jacket does not come into contact with your bare hands. and it goes without saying, but you should not hug anyone or throw your jacket at them. do not weaponize our jackets. rashes and lesions are not uncommon for those who neglect to heed this advice. don't: wear the jacket to the hard rock cafe we used to encourage this out of friendly competition, but the folks at the hard rock cafe did not feel the same cordial spirit. they'd regularly eject diners wearing the jacket and, in one case at a jacksonville location, lock a jacket-wearer in the underground prison usually reserved for unruly diners. yikes! also don't eat there, they are our competitors after all. do: not play sports in the jacket although you may associate planet hollywood with an active lifestyle (thanks to our many calorie-free options), you should avoid playing any sort of competitive or noncompetitive sport while wearing the jacket. the jacket was not designed to allow upward movement or downward movement, therefore prohibiting a person from participating in sports. you are totally able to move your upper body laterally while wearing the jacket, but what sport has this kind of motion? none to our knowledge, and we know a lot about sports. you are free to watch sports while wearing the jacket, just do not make any excessive movements. for example, maybe let someone else have control of the remote. don't: wear the jacket to funerals or important business meetings at $300, the planet hollywood jacket has the price of traditional funeral/business ware. unfortunately, due to the large emblazoning of planet hollywood on the back and front, the jacket is a little more pizzazz-y than most jackets that cost $300. that's not to say that the words planet hollywood on a jacket are in any way goofy, because they aren't, but there are almost certainly better things to wear to a funeral or an important business meeting. you may find that attentions shift from the corpse or the important business matter at hand to your jacket. and that's not good, is it? we've gotten enough letters from people who allegedly ruined various funerals and business meetings to know that this is the case. and we don't want to be known as the company that is associated with ruining funerals or business meetings. do: wear pants with the jacket the jacket does not cover your genitals, unless your genitals are located on your chest, which, in that case, maybe you are not the type of person we want repping the planet hollywood name to begin with. it's nothing against you personally, it's just that we would need to do a little more research and development into whether or not a chest-genitaled person would be good for our brand. all the data we currently have points to it being a good thing if people with properly-placed genitals wear our jackets. we'll get back to the chest-genitaled community as soon as we have conducted the research, which could be anywhere from 6 months to 2 years. sit tight, guys! don't: wear the jacket while committing a crime planet hollywood does not support criminal activity of any kind (unless you count our delicious mozzarella sticks, which are so good they should be illegal haha), but if you do feel the impulse to commit a crime, please do not wear a planet hollywood jacket while doing so. this would be a nightmare for our business. the last thing we need is someone named the planet hollywood serial killer running around, soiling our reputation. also, a plain jacket will help you be more incognito than you would be if you had the extremely identifiable planet hollywood logo proudly displayed on your jacket. please note that the last sentence is not us giving out advice on how to commit crimes, but rather just common sense. how many people do you see wearing planet hollywood jackets nowadays? in year 2014? not to spit on our own business venture, but the planet hollywood jacket is not exactly selling like hotcakes (which fyi we do not feature on our menu). we know this. we aren't stupid. would we like it to do better? sure, of course. but sometimes you need to be realistic. it sucks, but that's life. so it goes. keep on trucking. anyway, you'd be immediately identified, unless someone else in your town had their own planet hollywood jacket, which, in that scenario, you'd still most likely be identified because the police only need to be on the lookout for two possible suspects. do: drink 8 glasses of water before wearing the jacket the planet hollywood jacket has been known to inexplicably dehydrate those who wear it. we are not sure why. we use the same materials as all other jackets and more testing is being done to hopefully solve this horrible mystery. don't: wear the jacket in water it's bad for the material. also, jacket users who have been exposed to something even as small as rain have complained of a hissing sound when water hits the jacket (kind of like the cartoonish sound of acid hitting any surface). we advice that users drink the mandatory 8 glasses before wearing the jacket, just in case water happens to dribble out of your mouth onto the jacket. safety first! do: have just, like, a good time while wearing the jacket this doesn't even need an explanation or a qualifier. if you are the proud owner of a planet hollywood jacket you obviously already know how to have fun! brendan o'hare is attempting to be a writer and

because he is a 5'6, 140 pound withering man, who is wearing poorly-aged suspenders over a ragged white t-shirt that barely covers up the tattoo of betty boop on his right arm he got in north africa during world war ii. the axis wouldn t have cut him any slack, and neither will i. now, i will not stop slam dunking on grandpa. first off, respect your elders is an antiquated phrase. the animal kingdom pays this adage no mind, as the younger, hungrier animals, like lions or deer, are encouraged to take charge and show off their power over their weaker elders. it's the circle of life, and even though it is what nature intends, the human race ignores this. we demand that youth bow at the presence of a decrepit bag of bones and that the youth attend to their every whim. fetch me my slippers. hand me my medicine. please don't slam dunk on me. it's all anti-darwinian nonsense, if you ask me. our one-on-one games are building character, dad. for grandpa. as long as he's going to be living here, this is the way it's gonna have to be. yesterday, i had to spend 25 minutes explaining to him that the three-point line is a real thing and not something that came to me in a fever dream. i don't have time to explain to silly old men the past forty years of changes in the rules of the sport of basketball. the slam dunk is the simplest way to score two points. and to embarrass grandpa. also, the amount of heart medicine he's on gives him a clear advantage anyway. he doesn't need to be coddled. i've seen how he spends 10 minutes after breakfast every morning, meticulously taking them out of his pill box, his hands shaking as he nears his mouth, desperately trying to avoid accidentally jamming them up his nose. but he always makes it, and he never slam dunks one into his nasal cavity. he should have a steel heart by now. it's not my fault if he still needs to take a breath after every possession. is his coughing and hocking up mucus as a ploy to get my sympathy? i don't want to find out the hard way, that's for sure. he claims to have once almost beaten bob cousy in a game of one-on-one when he came to the springfield ymca in 1947 and, quite frankly, i'm sick of hearing about that shit. i think we all are. every powerful slam dunk reminds grandpa that the future is now, and that we aren't entering it quietly. when i'm hanging on the rim, staring intensely into his half-open eyes, i'm sending a message. when i tried to jump over grandpa in order to dunk and ended up hitting him in the head, suddenly sending him into a story about the positives of mccarthyism during which he spoke broken spanish, i was proving to him that i'd do anything to be the new top dog. my time is now, whether he likes it or not. my commitment to slam dunking on my feeble, osteoporotic grandpa is a noble one. get off the fucking court, dad. okay, your ball, grandpa. you're up 2. brendan o'hare is attempting to be a writer and comedian while living in nyc. follow

far less soccer knowledge than, say, someone who covers soccer for a living. many soccer writers, as well as many reporters in general, were very upset after complex media announced they were sending me down on their own dime. many writers, including some of those who work for this website, quit their jobs in anger of how inexplicable it is that i'm being sent to brazil. it doesn t make a whole lot of sense, but this is such a cool opportunity that i am not going to question it. i write this as i sit on the plane that will presumably take me to rio (i say presumably because of the uncertainty the malaysian incident has put into the hearts of all those who travel by air!), and i am so excited to watch the best soccer the world has to offer for the next month. few events unite the globe the way the world cup does, and it will be incredible to see all these different countries and cultures come together firsthand. i look forward to relaying my dispatches, as i believe this spectacle will inspire some of the best writing of my career. june 13: just arrived in my hotel, the beautiful sheraton barra hotel & suites. my room overlooks the great city of rio, but i will have to put staring out the window on hold as i am excited to get a few hours of shuteye before i spend tomorrow wandering around rio. i am hoping to interview some of the locals during my wandering. four pins has me strictly staying in rio for the world cup not traveling to the other locales in brazil where games will be played, like san paulo, but that's okay. i'm sure i'll be fine here. the first game in rio does not take place until june 15th, where argentina will take on bosnia-herzegovina. playing two countries at once sounds difficult, but i am sure argentina will be up for the challenge. i look forward to seeing that game. june 14: woke up and had a delicious continental breakfast in the lobby this morning: a danish and a black coffee, if you're wondering. i walked outside for about twenty minutes and interviewed two people (who really didn't give me a whole lot to work with) before i had to come inside and take a nap. still a little jet-lagged, i guess! before i knew it, it was 5pm and i figured no one wanted to be bothered on the streets so late. i didn't look into any of the local eateries (whoops!), so i ordered room service for dinner (an incredible medium-rare burger and fries!) and then watched hbo on the incredible 40-inch flat-screen the sheraton barra hotel & suites so graciously provide to all their guests. time for sleep now, i suppose. looking forward to seeing the game tomorrow! june 15: you just are not going to believe what happened to me today! the bus i was taking to the stadium broke down about halfway there. rats. what a bummer! unfortunately, i didn't know how to get to the stadium from where we were stranded, so i had to hike all the way back to my wonderful hotel room! to make matters worse, i didn't wear sunscreen, so i got a nasty burn on my neck and nose. ouch. i just stayed in my room for the rest of the day, applying anti-sunburn medication religiously. the bourne ultimatum was on hbo a film i very much enjoy so that made things somewhat bearable. the next game in rio is unfortunately not until the 18th, where spain will play chile (brrrrr! haha j/k). hopefully the bus will be repaired by then, and i can finally see a game! june 16: just tended to my sunburn today, nothing special. lucky for me the beds at the sheraton barra hotel & suites are very comfy and easy to relax on! june 17: received an email from my four pins editor, as he wanted to see what i had written so far. boy, was he not thrilled. some might even say he was the opposite of thrilled. apparently, he had expected more about the world cup and brazil, and less about my sunburn and the sheraton barra hotel & suites. he says i need to really step my game up, and he's right. tomorrow is the spain vs. chile match, and i am excited to go and watch, and really experience the world cup that i have unfortunately missed out on so far. i will not let my editor, me or you, the reader, down. just a side note: if you're ever staying in rio, i implore you to stay at the sheraton barra hotel & suites. it is a really excellent place to spend your down time at. june 18: took a me day and stayed in. june 19: rats! totally forgot the game yesterday. i stayed in my wonderful room, kept the blinds shut all day (as to prevent further sunburn) and watched hbo (the bourne ultimatum great flick!). i like the room service here so much that after i finished the june 17 correspondence, i wrote a list of food that i would like to eat for my three meals each day, to be delivered at the appropriate times. i'm doing this also so i don't have to keep bothering the staff with my calls. i dropped it off with the excellent customer service folk at the front desk, who were confused by my request at first, but then obliged once i started weeping. what can i say, i panicked! also, i've started wearing a bed sheet instead of my normal clothing because my clothes irritate my sunburn and the sheets provided by the sheraton barra hotel & suites are really topnotch in the softness department. the next game in rio isn't until the 22nd, and ugh, it's belgium vs. russia. june 20: just kind of stayed in bed all day. june 21: i ve started peeing into water bottles, but hear me out: i recently realized just how far away the bathroom is from my bed, and the bed at the sheraton barra hotel & suites is a really comfortable bed. i also decided to order $100 worth of food from room service, so i wouldn't have to keep interrupting my viewing of the bourne ultimatum. this way, all my food is right by my bed. pretty smart, huh? my editor called today and screamed at me. june 22: come on, there was no way i was going to go to the belgium vs. russia game, even if i had left my room at some point during the past week. june 23: my editor called me again today, and he was crying. he kept talking about how much money we spent on you and that i've become a shut-in who has completely lost his mind. when i protested (as i am want to do when someone comes at me with serious allegations like that!) he said anyone who watches that much bourne cannot be healthy. he also wonders if i will even be coming home, and if they'll need to get the jaws of life (can't be a real thing) to get me out of bed. good god man, cool it with the melodrama! i'm still writing, aren't i? it s not about the world cup or brazil or whatever, but something better. something that actually matters to me: the sheraton barra hotel & suites. oh yeah, i walked outside today because i dropped the remote out the window by mistake because the sun frightened me. june 24: my urine tastes better than i expected. june 25: just kind of took it easy today and stayed in bed. there might have been a game earlier in the day, but i'm not sure. my fingernails are really long. also, has anyone noticed that germs cover everything? june 26: i am writing this from an airplane. apparently, complex media was not confident that i would come home at the end of the world cup, so they decided to cut their losses and send 6 of their goons to forcibly remove me from my hotel room at the sheraton barra hotel & suites. what a bummer, i really enjoyed that hotel. i am disappointed that i will not be staying at it any longer, but i am confident that i can find similar sheratons in the united states. all in all, i would consider this trip a success. i got to visit a different country and i got to stay in a quality hotel. i watched the bourne ultimatum 77 times, which was nice. i drank my own urine, which was somewhat freeing. i also got to relax a lot. i like relaxing. it's a good way to spend one's time. i also found chilling out to be quite fun. well, this has been brendan o'hare, reporting from the 2014 world cup in brazil. i hope you enjoyed my correspondence and maybe even learned a thing or two. also, if you are ever in rio, i know of a great hotel you could stay out. just email me and i ll give you some more information. brendan o'hare is attempting to be a writer and

to further your career of standing outside of buildings to get street styled and then tweet about it, you ll realize three things: 1. yes, all these people are assholes. 2. only stand outside of buildings on cobblestone streets when it s slightly overcast because that s the best natural light and cobblestones are just straight up fucking classy. 3. you will start smoking. every person i know that has moved to new york city to work in fashion has started smoking within approximately 32 minutes. do you already smoke? hooray! you re already half way to your dream job! and emphysema! so, what am i here for? i m here to let you know what your cigarettes of choice say to the rest of the world. hold on to your black lung, kids, because shit's about to get really real.         did you really think we could only make snap judgments about your entire life based upon the brand of cigarettes you happen to be smoking, or the type of dog you happen to be walking? yeah fucking right, bro. i m so jaded and mean spirited that i make snap judgments about every tiny fragment of your life. this week i ve decided to judge you on your t-shirt game. why? because i can and because evidently this summer i m trying to alienate everyone around me.         do you wear jeans? if you're a human being, there is at least a 99% chance that you're wearing jeans right now. jeans are so ubiquitous that cool guys like us take pride in expressing our uniqueness through everything from insignificant manufacturing details to tiny rips and tears. our favorite jeans are our lances as we tip quixotically at the windmill of true individuality. raw denim, destroyed denim, dad denim, skinny denim, patchwork denim what does it all mean and, more importantly, what does your favorite pair of jeans say about

michael bastian s show because i had written this post that, naturally, was so goddamn hilarious i just had to be on the guest list. he was all,  too bad you re in fucking detroit, dickbag.  homie was essentially double dog daring me to come to nyc for the week of the fashions. well, i called his bluff and i was out there in a hot minute. this is the diary of my first new york fashion week. you think you know, but you have no idea.         after my first new york fashion week, i'm not gonna lie, i was really feeling myself. when everyone back home asked where i had been i had the illest flex: oh, you know, just checking out some shows at fashion week. yeah, that's what i do for a living. i was so amped for my next fashion week, i was seriously waiting for invites for six months straight. but the closer to february we got, the more worried i became. i mean, i literally had like two invites in my inbox a week before go time. while i still blame this glaring oversight by pr companies on gmail going down, i was beginning to question if i was going to go at all. yeah fucking right. like i'm gonna miss the sheer fuckery that is nyfw just because some brands got all snobby in the span of six months. it's almost as if they don't want me slanderizing their events and showing up with decidedly terrible accessories like canes and unkempt beards. but after a quick email to my editors, i decided that the tradition needed to stay alive had to stay alive. so, i got my hair did, threw everything i own into two bags and tested my influence levels for my second new york fashion week. peep game.         read jon's first diary here and his second diary here. did you guys know this past week was not just a normal week, but fashion week in new york city? i know, it's like no one was even talking about it. well, thank yahweh i'm here to wrap everything up like a neat, steezy little package and give you fuccbois some closure on the s/s 15 shows. yeah, that's right, they invited me back for a third time, motherfuckers. i don't know why my editors think it's a good idea to continually be seen with me in public or who convinced various pr companies that i need to be in attendance at their clients' very costly, very important fashion shows, but you can bet your very last fucking jawn that i'm gonna become a fixture of the new york fashion scene despite living in fucking detroit. is it 'cause a blogger handsome and wealthy? probably not, but maybe.         make sure you read jon's first, second and third new york fashion week diaries so he will feel good about himself. did you guys realize this is my fourth fourth! new york fashion week? that means for the past two years or so, i've been a straight up regular an insider, if you will. an #influencer and a trendsetter. some might even say street style demigod. been two fashion weeks since somebody asked me who i was drake voice. but, really, everyone just keeps asking me why i keep coming back. jokes on them, though. i got all the pr agency emails. i'm coming to every nyfw 'til the end of time. who gon' stop me? okay, enough chest-beating. let's get into it...                 to stunt is human. life is a constant quest to crawl to the next level and shit on those below you. never sweat. never allow a perceived chink in your armor to gleam. the fuccbois will descend upon you and pick at it. no, you are a self-assured, swag monarch. it me, bauce sauce, your spiritual dr. stephen r. covey, here to supply a veritable 12 stunting habits of highly legendary people. this is a framework to use to elevate your station from bumbling plebeian into deliberate, merciless flex f hrer. throughout your day there are ample opportunities to stunt, but the commoner ignores their moment to shine, opting rather to slink back into the safe shadows. fam, i wish you could see me right now. i'm looking at you and s'ing my fucking h right now. if you want to become a top-tier humanoid then absorb my teachings. adopt my ways. apply my wisdom. follow me on my journey. this is it's nothing to stunt: a day in the life of bauce sauce. justin roberson is a legend. follow him on twitter here.         get money gut, motherfuck a diet. - waka flocka flame lies have been purposely wholesaled to the masses since the definition of honesty was celestially invented. the largest is the myth that women enjoy abdominal muscles. sorry to break it to all you #gymflow bros out there doing mathemafamatics to calculate the perfect riboflavin intake and staying in the anaerobic zone with thermogenics 24/7, but abs make you look like a teenage mutant ninja turtle. and no woman is trying to let a mutant amphibian slide inside her lady cave. women simply don't like abs. what women do like are guts: blubbery mounds of stagnant calories. they love the security and warmth a girthy midsection brings with it. they also love rappers. so what happens when rappers themselves have guts? cheese eggs happen. that's what. rappers are already swimming in trim, and always fucking my bitch and fucking your bitch and fucking your dad's bitch and fucking their bitch's (who is also still, somehow, our bitch) bitches. so, when a rapper achieves a gut it's game over. we might as well get the obituaries ready because when they die there is only one cause of death: pussy juice poisoning. let's look at the current state of affairs re: the best rapper guts doing it today. justin roberson is out here eating. you can follow him on twitter here.         being a swaglord is exhausting. not only do you have to be out here constantly influencing and going to open bars and building with fam, but you have to always be on top of the most current cool teen  slanguage. that's its own separate job in and of itself, as cool teens  have no regard for anything. they do not respect swaglords. they do not respect authority. they are a bunch of lawless, wild beasts. as of today, march 5, 2015, their most popular phrase du jour is it's lit, or one of its various derivatives, such as like for example, lit like bic and oh, it's fuckin' lit. and, though it is approaching the end of its life cycle as it has recently reached celebrity mom usage, it is a succinct phrase to denote that everything is about to, or already has, gotten considerably wild. adhd sonically personified aka rae sremmurd (which is supposed to be ear drummers backwards, but that would technically be sremmurd rae) have replaced future as the ambassadors of the shirk responsibilities and do whatever to find a semblance of joy movement, but the crux of the matter at hand is identifying when something is actually, truly lit. misreading a social lituation can lead to ostracism. if a funeral is not, in fact, lit and you start pouring sparkling moscato on the open casket corpse, there will be consequences your rich dad cannot get you out of. thankfully, you read four pins more than once so you are already clued in. but, as with with everything, deeper insight can always be gained from professionals. you think the pins pays me a cool fifteen bucks a think piece if i didn t know what i was talking about? bruh, i stay seeking out transient happiness at the cost of alienating my loved ones. so, get out your fucking notepad. this is your field guide to identifying if it's lit. justin roberson got penalized in rehab cuz a bitch was 'bout to commit suicide and he said, oh, it's fuckin' lit. follow him on twitter here.         we are born and begin to flex. before we possess the requisite gross motor or language skills to facilitate the flex ourselves, our parents do it for us. they dress us up in the cutest, least practical alphets. they brag to other parents about whatever stupid thing we did once by accident to one-up whatever stupid thing their kid once did by accident. this would later be the basis of facebook dot com, which revolutionized the reach with which people could brag about the stupid things their kids did once by accident. as you become a cool teen , you take ownership of your flex. you choose the music you listen to. you choose the shoes you buy. you choose the ladies you will criminally pester until they feel sorry for you and give you an hj behind the bowling alley during spirit week. as the great philosopher olmec once opined, the choices are yours, and yours alone! it's all about staying on top of every microtrend. unfortunately, as you age, the amount of free time you are left with to keep up with your non-revenue-creating passions dwindles exponentially. i remember hearing something about half-lifes in chemistry class when i was in high school, but that day i was too busy leering at a cute girl's nice butt because she was wearing those jeans with no back pockets. and it's like, wow, i'm very thankful for that jean style because it does not mar the glory of the lady butt. also, why were back pockets ever invented? they were probably invented by a dude that didn't appreciate a tasty lady haunch, you know? i vaguely remember what a half-life is, but i think it works as an analogy here. if it doesn't, might i suggest googling nice lady butts instead of leaving some insufferable fuccboi comment correcting me. the nerds that edit these four pins pieces will probably plop a swagless [editor's note: a half-life is the amount of time something has before it becomes more swagless] clarification anyways. [actual editor's note: bauce is right. a half-life is the amount of time required for a quantity to fall to half its value as measured at the beginning of the time period.] i come from a line of audiophiles and home theater enthusiasts. one uncle designs sound systems for mega churches and another owned his own custom car audio business. my dad has tube amplifiers that cost more than my car. i worked at best buy for three years in college before becoming cedia-certified and designing lighting control and entire home control systems. i'm going to know everything about consumer electronics for all eternity! i remember thinking to myself. after a job and industry change five years ago, i don't even know what the fuck 4k tvs are. when i worked at best buy, a motif i noticed, but didn't become meaningful until i was 10 years removed from the situation, was that there were always 40-50-year-old married guys who would come in looking for new audio receivers. they didn't need new speakers to go with it, just the receiver. but why? because the receiver they bought in college 20 years prior had died on them. they still had their very expensive b&o or klipsch loudspeakers, they just needed a new receiver. i found it odd, but then i got married and had a kid. my money no longer went to things i liked, but to things i was obligated to: bills, diapers, hoa fees, etc. i understood now why all their possessions, the things that were truly theirs, dated back to before marriage. though it may seem like your life is over after getting married and having a kid, it isn't. you just have to embrace your new station in life. once you realize that your days of flexing are not numbered it's like being born again. i can no longer try to be hip. i can no longer attempt to be youthful without looking pathetic (shouts to all the 30-year-olds rocking affliction shirts, i admire your commitment). i can't go buy every new consumer electronic and flaunt it. i'm no longer an early adopter. i'm a whenever-i-get-around-to-it adopter. i've accepted that. and i've become better for it. i'm not obsolete. i still matter. i still flex. however, now i flex via actions instead of things. if you are on the pins, then flexing on fuccbois is your hobby. fortunately, it can be a lifelong pursuit if you adapt. i went to disney world last month with my wife, my 2-year-old daughter, my mom, my sister, my niece, my nephew, my sister's fiance and his daughter. if that sounds like a terrible idea, you are correct. why go? well, my sister, who didn't get an english degree (like me) and has a lot of money (unlike me), said she'd pay for my family to go. how could i not? the modern stereotype of the dad irks me. the cheap joke on any sitcom or movie is to frame the dad as an unaware dingus who can't do anything right. i rebuke this characterization as it is wildly outdated. my dad never changed one of my diapers while i've changed a thousand diapers and accidentally had more poop get on me at any given time than a bang bros. ass parade actor. my goal when i went to disney world aka the place that nightmares have nightmares about was to be the most elite dad that place had ever seen... while we are on the shuttle bus, i'm wearing the diaper bag/backpack and standing with the folded up city elite  stroller by baby jogger. and, in some cases, doing all this while holding my 30 pound daughter and fighting back cramps. i'm asking if my daughter needs a pouch (to non-dads, a pouch is, like, an applesauce capri sun), or her minnie mouse ears or if my wife needs a water (of which i have 8 carefully packed into one of the 5 backpack compartments). the goal is to bear the brunt of the stress and make my wife's life easier. if you were to survey the bus, all the other dads would be completely oblivious and on their phones. i could feel their wives eye-fucking me, banking the memory of a strong dad  being so goddamned proactive to masturbate to later. i could smell the mature pussy self-lubricating. i bet he puts the dishes in the dishwasher without even having to be asked. i'm on fucking fire when we get into the park. i'm making sure everyone has water. i've got the fastpasses queued up because i stayed up for 5 hours the night prior planning out everything, even snagging the highly coveted fastpasses to meet anna and elsa. (real dads know what i'm talking about. all you single dudes who are confused just know this is basically like a willy wonka golden ticket.) i've memorized the map. i'm checking wait times. i know where all the bathrooms are. i've tapped into the matrix. all the other dads are just sitting on the sideline admiring me. when my daughter cries because she is scared to death of a disney character that we just waited 30 minutes to see because she said she wanted to meet them, i don't get agitated. i console her and ask if she wants to go on the teacup ride for the 20th time that day. meanwhile, a dad not 10 feet away is yelling at his kid about dropping his ice cream bar. wow, how is he so perfect? a stranger mom blurts a little too loudly within earshot. the things i'd do to him if he was my husband, a nearby milf says, perhaps accidentally, out loud. i wish i was him, a shameful bystander dad utters. i'm really the swaglord of this disney shit. and it has nothing to do with my alphet or any possession. i'm wearing a fubu backpack, levi's and a croft & barrow golf polo, but i'm still flexing. let's call it age-appropriate stunting. it was a highlight of my life better than the time i got my first blowjob and my whole body started to tingle, better than the time my boy hooked me up with a free chick-fil-a breakfast, better than the time i got the ill corporate health insurance and copped some generics for free. in that moment, i had engaged and initiated cool dad  mode. i had applied moonstone. i had evolved. when my daughter decided she wanted to play in the water fountain/splash park area and asked me to play with her, i went along. i was wearing white shorts and all the while getting soaked. my dingaling print looked like a hand shovel protruding out of a sandbox. i didn't care. i was having fun because my daughter was having fun. all the other dads were sitting literally and figuratively sitting on the bench while their kids ran around sad because that was the exact moment they realized their dad was a pathetic lame. if you are on the pins, then flexing on fuccbois is your hobby. fortunately, it can be a lifelong pursuit if you adapt. we can't be cool teens  forever. our swag eventually goes through puberty and we become cool manchildren . with proper reflection, and a little luck, we can all die on top of a pile of our own shit in an assisted living facility as cool geriatrics  draped in the most fire robes. the un-flexed life is one not worth living. godspeed, my babies. justin roberson is the coolest cool dad . ask him to be your father on twitter here.         wake up, wake up, flex your muscles, god! - isaiah 51:11, the message (msg) god flexed. i mean, what do you call building an entire universe from scratch? inventing dinosaurs and (no) homosapiens was just one gigantic fucking disrespectful flex: manufacture flawed entities and have them attempt to find solace in a world (you created) that delivers nothing but suffering. that connection to our maker still exists. the need the want, the desire to flex surges through our veins. life is nothing more than a competition. to flex is human. it is an instinct. found deep within our horny lizard brains, the dulled synapses fire an almost 24/7 message of flex! flex! flex! in response to each situation we encounter. why wouldn't you flex every chance you get? perhaps, you are a pathetic milksop (tbh this is probably the reason). though, sometimes, unfortunately, decorum dictates that you, in fact, not flex. while we are free to flex a majority of the time, no flex zones exist. thanks to who i believe are two elementary school students, rae sremmurd, the awareness of no flex zones is at an all-time high. however, at no point in their hit song do they make mention of what to do when you find yourself in one. these cowards merely reinforce the rhetoric of the obama administration: you know you aren't supposed to flex here so don't even think about it. fuck that. last time i checked, this is america, and bush did 9/11. if i want to flex, boy howdy, i am going to flex. like our human origins, our country's origins are steeped in flexing when we shouldn't have: thank you so much for saving us during that cruel winter, native americans. here, have these totally-not-laced-with-small-pox blankets. to aid you in your quest to be a top flexer, we've compiled a handy guide to flexing in a, that's right, no flex zone justin roberson is flexing right now. can you tell? follow him on twitter here.         you might not remember the day you discovered your first pubic hair. you probably don't remember where you were the day bush did 9/11. but, we all remember what we were doing on june 28, 2013 floating to the heavens from elation. that was the day we first saw terrio's vine of him throwing a basketball and then humping the air with such fervor and force and passion that belies his six short years on this earth. a few days later, his cousin maleek would document his now world famous molly dance and nothing was the same. capturing our hearts with a few jiggles, he was no longer maleek s cousin terrio; he was our cousin terrio. terrio's transformation from child to international sex symbol has also brought about a level of swag hitherto seen or known. terrio started this off as an innocent magikarp flailing about, and has since evolved into the swagyarados he is today. it is important we chronicle this historic process, as our children may grow up believing that secretary of swagriculture terrio was an urban legend. no way a child possessed that much swag! they will yell, and you will simply point them to this think piece. pay attention, and you too may even pick up a swag nugget or two to apply to your own life. ooo kill 'em. ooo kill 'em. ooo kill 'em, indeed. ooo, justin roberson just killed 'em. you can follow him on twitter here.         ever been hitting the bong with your bros and the kush is so loud that you come up with a million dollar idea? then, you butt chug some molly water and decide to convince everyone to venmo you $20,000? then, you hire a grip of developers to actualize your idea? well, that's exactly what happened to us last week during our weekly boys' night out get together. in that moment, when we were stoned out of our minds and rolling our rectums off, it all made complete sense. but, now that we've sobered, it makes complete fucking sense. lmao, fam, why hasn't there been a video game created about internet minutia and menswear and blogging? i seriously can't believe none of you dweebs out there didn't think of this first. i'm imagining all of your salty faces right now and it's giving me a flex boner . anyhow, we just got the first test copy of four pins: the video game and wanted to preview it for you guys. the release date is set. q4 2014 is officially on lock. we have a feeling this is going to be the next tickle me elmo. justin roberson already beat four pins: the video game to 100% completion. follow him on twitter here.         alphet: is it just a silly word? on the surface, it certainly seems as such. is it a pejorative, tongue-in-cheek mocking of the great linguist french montana? on the surface, to a plebeian, it's very possible to appear that way. but all nuance is missed on a cursory glance. detail is lost when looking at anything from 30,000 feet. an alphet is not simply an outfit. have we used alphet in jest here at four pins? sure. we have also used every word in modern language in jest because those are the rules of this menswear blog shit. alphet is not a noun. alphet is not a word. it is a signifier of an indescribable feeling: that overwhelming swell of esteem that starts deep in the cockles of your heart that replaces your marrow, courses through your sinews, emanates through your very being and oozes through your pores when you look at yourself in the mirror and every fucking detail is on point. your inseam is the perfect length to achieve the perfect stacking atop your perfect footwear. you've got the golden ratio of high and low fashion. your blacks match, looking like the eternal nothingness we face after we die. your whites are blinding, seemingly so bright they make people regret the gift of sight they've been given. you aren't retaining the water weight you were yesterday, so your tailoring is extra flattering. your accessories enhance without distracting. your hair is so coiffed that samson himself would shave his own follicles out of sheer jealousy: i mean, his hair shines with a light from within. why even bother having hair when his hair looks like that? you look like a god. you are god. that is an alphet. perhaps the closest we will ever get to knowing if an intergalactic deity exists is by compiling the most fire collage of clothing imaginable on our person. in those moments, you operate on a higher plane. you become a prophet with a direct connection to the spiritual realm. you are the plug to the plug. think about it this way: every decision ever made, and every event that has ever happened in the history of time has led to this moment. an alphet bolsters your soul. it erases all weaknesses. it rejects the idea of a meaningless existence. it shuns mortality. it dissipates the fog of darkness that chokes us every second of every day. it provides a buffer to the pain. an alphet is transformative, the obtect pupa that protects you, facilitating your metamorphosis into a radiant swaglord. alphets are, after all, but a costume nothing more than a textile exoskeleton. they are a representation of our very essence, but it is a costume. its purpose is to be the physical manifestation of our entire life story and, yet, at the same time, the purest distillation of our current mood. we hope to simultaneously inform strangers of what we are about and who we are through the ancient, primordial language of fabrication. don't fuck with me. i'll stunt on everything you hold dear, you pathetic fuccboi. i'm feeling hella libidinous. let's smear genitals. i am better than you. you want your book judged by its cover because your rick owens durag is completely and utterly fucking flawless. be wary of the volatility of an alphet, as they are transitory by nature. they may feel like wearable lazarus pits, but permanence is a fool's ideal. time can be tamed by no one and happiness is fleeting. even if you wear the same combination of clothing a few weeks later, it will not be the same. the moon won't be in the same phase and everything around you will be different. you'll be chasing that high for the rest of your time on earth. if you are extremely lucky, you'll possibly achieve full alphet nirvana maybe 10 times in your entire life. sure, you will come close. you may even convince yourself you've done it. but you'll know that you are lying to yourself. never take an alphet for granted. if your plans fall through, make new plans. do not waste this ethereal gift sitting at home watching torrented episodes of the adventures of pete & pete. you are captain ahab harpooning that great white whale. you have found a holographic charizard on the floor of your middle school bathroom. this shit is rarer than lil b dming you back. harness it and wield it wisely. cling to that power like a rosary. eke out every ounce of euphoria. think about it this way: every decision ever made, and every event that has ever happened in the history of time has led to this moment. if a triceratops had escaped a tyrannosaurus instead of being eating 66 million years ago, you not might be here, in the present rocking, the flyest of alphets. hell, you might not have even been born. so, how do you create an alphet? there are no hard and fast rules, but it starts with listening to that voice in the back of your head. that is our ancient lizard brain that has been robbed of its legitimacy through millions of years of evolution. that's the voice that you should always listen to. that's the voice telling you, yeah, man, definitely do not have sex with this person that probably has herpes, that you ignore 30 seconds before having sex with a person who definitely has herpes. that voice is not ever present, but, when it pops up to chime in, listen to it. don't ask one of your swaggerless trashfriends which shirt you should wear because they will pick the wrong one. you already know which shirt to wear. you already know what pants to wear. you already know what ensemble to craft. be decisive and don't question the masterpiece you are painting on your body. never ask, should i? just do it. when we say alphet, know that we are doing so in earnest. we love clothes so much and we take this shit deadly serious. we are all on this journey called life, trying to be draped up and dripped out in the finest garb amalgam any human has ever seen. ultimately, it is you, and you alone, that can achieve a dream alphet. keep layering. keep matching. keep mismatching. keep trying. and, when you do put together that quintessential alphet? take as many pictures as humanly possible. feelings may be temporary, but selfies are forever. justin roberson is a decorated and esteemed alphetologist. follow him on twitter here.         i am not swaggerless. as a prerequisite to write for the pins, you have to submit to rigorous swag testing. lawrence personally flies out to your home and combs through your closet. if he doesn't pour the contents of your trash can into it, symbolically representing that your wardrobe is garbage, you make it to step two. lawrence then berates you for a superfluous amount of time about your style/hair/relationship choices. if you don't cry, you've made it through to round three. complex developed some very expensive photo recognition software that combs through all selfies past, present and future to determine what percentage of your alphets are and will be bricks. if you pass that, you can finally freelance for four pins and swim in the fucking money at $12.50 per written piece. so, it's a certifiable fact that i'm not swaggerless, but i was definitely stuck in alphet limbo. i've matured and grown over the past few year, but my wardrobe had not. mostly consisting of expensive brand dress shirts, pants and suits passed on to me from my dad that were hella fire (but loose and ill-fitting), the rest of my clothes were bought while i was in college. this may not sound too bad, but i am from the south and went to college during the height of prep, which means a lot of pastels and all-over animal prints. i actually didn't get a job because i wore salmon-colored chinos to an interview. i've been languishing at a job that i hated, but should have been been thankful for. (the same job i didn't get the first time i interviewed because i wore salmon pants, which would later become my nickname). i didn't feel challenged. i slacked off, like, a lot. like, whole days of just tweeting and reading fire think pieces. i couldn't remember the last time i cared at work. it affected my year end review. ultimately, my raise was deferred until i proved that i could be good at my job. such bullshit. i had been mulling over the idea of revamping my wardrobe and starting small with fancy sweatpants. all of the sweatpants i owned were $10 jawns from old navy with holes in the pockets or oversized asbestos-stuffed jawns that my dad bestowed upon me from the '70s. the only thing i wanted for christmas was those aforementioned fancy sweats, which i had to inform my wife meant probably $100. sometimes, life allows you to quit being a fuccboi. when the homie top shelf tyson tweeted about fancy sweatpants, i innocently asked for brand recommendations and, because we were fam that had spent upwards of four hours building on twitter, he dmed me and asked for my size. to this day, i don't know what that guy does or who he really is, but two weeks later i had a pair of unyforme sweatpants that felt like heaven on body. thank god for building with fam. i had so much room for my dangle satchel to grandfather clock. i was a new man. in the infamous words of fellow pins contributor drew millard, drop crotch pants are meant to hide secrets. the sweatpants had sparked my soul. i was woke. the next day at work, i jokingly asked our branch president what our policy was on fancy sweatpants. after 10 minutes of google image searches she said, wear them tomorrow and i'll vote on whether or not to allow them. hitherto, i had almost exclusively worn sperry topsiders and allen edmonds. fortunately, i purchased my first sneakers a week prior, a simple pair of black vans. this was a huge deal because, outside of suits, i had less than three pieces of black clothing. dead ass, everything good in my life over the past month has been because of those fancy sweatpants. the american dream aka the ability to wear sweatpants to work had seemingly come together through fate. the universe wanted me to flourish. i was stressed. i couldn't fuck this up. i hit up my alphet attach , sweatpants papi, for help and he artfully suggested a black and white striped polo. i layered it with a lightweight bubble jacket and the recently bought vans and felt like a gawd. this was the first time i had ever worn a majority murdered out fit that wasn't a. the subsequent alphet could technically be classified as business very casual or comfort goth and, most importantly, it worked. it was professional enough. my boss actually approved. i had successfully amended the dress code. fancy sweatpants were now an acceptable article of clothing. ya boy single-handedly toppled the fascist capitalist state. but there was an unexpected consequence of all this: i started doing good at work. i was more nimble, more capable of swiftly taking care of client needs because of the aforementioned crotch cavern. clothes do make the man. it was an external change that facilitated an internal one. i was looking good and feeling good. i cared what i looked like. i cared about what i did. i cared about my work reputation. simply, i cared. i no longer looked like a homeless dude in oversized and mismatched sweats when running dad errands  on saturday mornings. i copped a tailor. i started talking to co-workers in small doses. i bought a second pair of sneakers. i got offered some side work that made me some very nice extra money. i was given new responsibilities at work and didn't shirk them. wearing those fancy sweatpants augmented my entire fucking life. after initially deferring my raise (which would've been about 5%), my boss ended up giving me a 20% raise, which is almost unheard of. and it was all because of those sweats. dead ass, everything good in my life over the past month has been because of those fancy sweatpants. i'm certainly thankful for fancy sweatpants, but also for internet friends . let this be a testament to never turning down any opportunity to build with fam. unlike your family, when you need guidance, fam will always be there for you. i'm happier than i've been in years. getting out of a rut requires you making a change. as it turns out, it doesn't have to be some grand transformation. it can be something small that snowballs. it was through the power of the alphet that i found my redemption. happy holidays, guys. i can only hope you're feeling as #blessed as i am. justin roberson is doing great, guys. follow him on twitter here.         every generation develops a new technology that completely changes the course of humanity. sir isaac newton created gravity. christopher columbus invented america. zac morris originated sexting. steve jobs discovered the apple phone. these are all fine inventions, but the greatest innovation of the modern world is easily the jean short aka the jort aka the wearable pussy soaker . much like electricity and sriracha, no one knows exactly who invented jorts. folklore has it that after jesus turned water into wine, he turned everyone's robe bottoms into jorts so that they would no longer be restricted in their turn up movements. regardless, the jort genesis  will forever remain a mystery. but what isn't a mystery is the inherent utility of jorts. men's shorts these days, much like millennials themsevles, are dainty and not durable. eat some bbq ribs and one wipe of your sauce-laden fingers will make your twill cargos disintegrate. jorts, however, are indestructible. jorts are the juicy j of the alphet world. they are incapable of dying and possess a seemingly infinite relevance. 2014 is the year of the jort  and there is nothing you can do about it, but clad your sexy ass haunches in abridged denim. combat jack predicted their return earlier this year. james harden wore them while throwing out the first pitch for the houston astros. the wave is undeniable. i know you're probably thinking, cool satire and hyperbole, buddy, but you won't catch me wearing jorts our here in these steaming summer streets. first off, it's not hyperbole. secondly, i'm not your buddy, buddy. this is me, sitting in front of a computer, standing in front of you, bringing the feeling  back to new york (or wherever you happen to live). here is a handy list of people who rock jorts on the reg: stone cold steve austin,  marc wahlberg (of marky mark and the funky bunch fame), shia lebeouf,  gheorghe the not so gentle giant muresan, this fucking legend who is the face of the wikipedia page for jorts, andre agassi (who wore them while winning all the tennis) and, of course, the motherfucking og secretary of swagriculture himself, soulja boy. if you wouldn't want to be a part of that veritable who's who of american heroes, then fuck right off and emigrate. conversely, here is an equally handy list of people who did not rock jorts on the reg, or ever: hitler. hmmm, really makes you think. to further illustrate my point, i'd like to direct you to the dope ass venn diagram (above) that i created by running a super complicated, genius level regression analysis in excel using hella macros. jorts can be the cornerstone to a strong look, and your refusal to acknowledge this is why your tinder/grindr game is rubbish, why your life is worthless and why your progeny will be mired in fuccboism for generations to come. fuccbois beget fuccbois. cop some jorts and break this cursed cycle. i can personally attest to gaining more than 20 facebook friends after i posted a picture of me wearing jorts. my wife of five years also let me have sex with her for the first time after laying eyes on me wearing jorts. do not block your blessings. jorts are the best of both worlds, like a mullet. let your beautiful, powerful hindquarters breathe. permit your shin follicles to feel the compassionate summer breeze. allow that denim to keep your peen protected. get yourself some jorts and finally realize what it truly feels like to be alive. justin roberson is willing to die for these jorts, man. follow him on twitter here.         when drake unleashed a song in the midst of his trophies build-up, it did not feature any of the usual big-name suspects that dominate popular radio and music blogs. many people, h8rz included, were surprised to find soulja boy, of all rappers, getting opening and closing duty on we made it. he's irrelevant! they shouted. oh, soulja boy's on it? pass! one tweeted. what is this? 2009? another h8r proudly posted. see, he never went away you just stopped paying attention. what them h8rz weren't aware of is that they were being stunted on by a man who has a long and storied history of stunting on them h8rz. do you think some internet stranger's joke tweet or an ex-lover's jealousy is going to affect a man named soulja boy who made a song about stopping joseph kony, effectively condemning boy soldiers? the answer is, decidedly, no. including soulja on we made it turned out to be one of the savviest tricks drake has ever pulled. the song is a testament to overcoming and unabashedly flaunting your success much to the chagrin of nonbelievers. rub that shit in the naysayers faces like apricot scrub it's good for them. soulja boy is the main reason this song is so delightful. the chorus and beat are anthemic, sure, but, the highlight is soulja interrupting drake's verse to inform us, damn, soulja boy stunt on them haters. he sounds taken aback by his own actions, as if he can't believe the ferocity and malice with which is he able to stunt on them h8rz. but, much like whitney houston, soulja boy simply doesn't know his own strength, for he has stunted on them h8rz for so long that at this point it basically happens subconsciously. stunting pulses through soulja's body it lives deep within his sinew. we aren't here to argue soulja's talent (limitless and diverse) or his place in the current landscape of rap (he is a legend). we're not saying soulja boy is a better rapper than pimp c because he has crashed two bentleys, while pimp c has only crashed one, however compelling that evidence may be. we are here to document deandre way's steadfast commitment to stunting on them h8rz through his actions and laboriously put together outfits. perhaps, we could all learn a thing or two from the master. damn, justin roberson just stunted on them haters. you can follow him on twitter here.         four pins has won many awards (for legal purposes we can t tell you what they are) for our tireless dedication to journalism . we document the zeitgeist. we scour for the best memes. we are constantly watching for the next movement bubbling up from the disgusting cauldron stew that is the internet so that we can exploit it for that sweet, sweet ad revenue. much like salmon-colored shorts, capitalism never goes out of style. there is a new trend amongst #influencers that is coursing across america: being washed. no longer is it cool to be oucheah or even attempt to chase virility well into your 50's. no, it's now all about being a lethargic knapsack of shit and old af. teens are actively rejecting their youthfulness and freedom to stay at home instead of attempting to have sex with each other!  twenty-somethings are proud of being preemptively middle-aged. is it drake's fault? most likely. do you have reserves of enthusiasm? do you like to do things? well, with a few tweaks to your normal routine you can stop being a dumbass lame and become cool for once in your life. here is the four pins guide to being washed. go to sleep early getting a good night sleep is essential to being washed. if you are going to miss out on every surprise album release and seminal pop culture moment then start passing out moments after dusk. you'll have to adjust your meal times to maintain this long-term, but having supper alone at 4:00pm at applebee's is actually very lit and affordable. plus, you can get the 2 for $20 deal and not have to share the 'tizer. fall asleep during tv shows and movies between all the sleeping, you won't have much time to stay abreast of important entertainment and with the advent of dvrs and netflix it's nearly impossible to have an excuse for why you have never seen game of thrones. the only two options for you are: 1. tell people, i actually don't own a tv, but then you go from being washed (and cool) to being an untouchable. 2. fall asleep while watching them so you have the excuse that you are getting caught up. i have dozed off during john woo's 1992 classic hard boiled three times in the last 7 days. i haven't even made it past 30 minutes. since i'm not sure exactly at what point i fell asleep, i have to start back at the beginning each time. i fell asleep during true detective's fourth episode and didn't even know it. i started watching last week's episode and realized i had no clue what was going on. i had to go back and rewatch, but i fell asleep again. i may never actually finish this season and i'm okay with that realization. i mean, i never planned to. shit sucks. be tired all the time despite being rested did you really think that just because you got 14 hours of sleep that you were supposed to be energized? no, you are still going to be tired because you got too much sleep, which makes you need more sleep. it's a lovely perm press cycle. start taking vitamins vitamins are actually very cool. the way they just eliminate free radicals and stop inflammation in your joints when the barometric pressure drops below 30 >>>>>>.  you don't have to be swaggerless and nibble on some flintstones chewables. get creative! buttchug some melted down krill oil. maybe even pour a four of centrum liquid in a 2-liter of sprite #sponsored.  about to smoke a glucosamine blunt i'm so washed   roc (@rocmodernlife) july 19, 2015  don't finish any beer you ever order this sounds wasteful, but it's not intentional. a few swigs of alcohol will make you tired. (and you are, remember? you are sleeping 14 hours a day. what are you even doing out at a bar/restaurant ordering a beer?) you won't even be able to make it all the way through that hoppy ipa before feeling like you need a quick 4 hour catnap. never go outside earl tried to tell you, but you didn't listen. outside is trash. inside is classic. since you are taking all those aforementioned vitamins, you don't need to rely on the sun for vitamin d. and since i wrote that sentence as a segue for me to talk about how the sun is garbage, let's talk about how the sun is garbage: first, it is unnecessarily hot. second, you can't even look directly at it without it harming you like a basilisk. third, the baby from teletubbies was creepy and haunts my dreams to this day. without an actual sun, he doesn't exist. fourth, its cartoon depiction always has it wearing sunglasses like some chill bro, but since it is the sun, it doesn't need shelter from its own light or need to protect it's stupid hydrogen eyes from its own uv rays. seriously, sheeple, wake the fuck up. why is the government trying so hard to convince us that the sun is cool? fuck the sun. there is literally no reason to ever leave your home. stop doing things altogether don't do things. ever. even if something sounds like fun, don't. the concept of fun should repulse you. the idea of having to go anywhere outside of your abode should fill you with so much anxiety that you collapse on the bathroom floor and shake for several hours. once your body has softened from atrophy, it will be difficult to do things anyways. your body will hurt for no reason. if you even look at a basketball, you'll pull a groin muscle. god forbid you actually play a game of pick-up. still make plans to do things, though. remember, we are going for washed not leper. give non-answers to all invites. for example: coworker: want to hit happy hour with us after work? you: conceivably.  friend: we're fam building at beloved this saturday, you in? you: i'll see if i can swing it.  mom: your grandmother's funeral is tomorrow. can you be a pallbearer? you: perchance. after enough times, there will be a tacit understanding that you will not be at anything ever and people will stop asking. don't do anything in a timely manner i sent lawrence the pitch for this article on june 2, 2015. i was too busy sleeping and hating myself to get it done until now. do i care? as long as that sweet $20 check from complex clears, nope. lose interest in your passions part of achieving this will happen naturally because you won't have as much time to stay on top of things that you care about. however, there are still those pesky 10 hours when you aren't sleeping and you may be tempted to read an internet website. though i wouldn t recommend that, it's okay because you quickly realize how out of touch you are and subsequently abandon it completely out of frustration. i used to design and install home theaters and lighting control systems...but that that was before the war...things are different now. i have no clue what a 4k tv is. i am genuinely frightened of curved televisions. i used to be an early adopter. i used to understand and love technology. i am now confused by snapchat. rebuke youth culture once you are truly out of touch with the world, you will become angry, angry at the freedom that others have, specifically the youth and, like, whatever the hell it is they are doing. their innovation scares you. their happiness befuddles you. their exuberance vexes you. i am personally scared of all teens because i know at a moment's notice they could reduce me from man to meme in a viral second. maybe they invented a new bofa approach i'm not aware of? maybe they make me the star of a popular vine? maybe one of them straight up tweets me that i'm a cell phone hip case wearing aaron carter with a pituitary gland problem face ass lookin boy. to all cool teens , please do not own me on the web. i beg you. spend a few hours a week shouting at some stupid altostratus to keep your vocal cords warm for when you need to tell some children to get off your lawn. the world was a better place when you were growing up, that's for damn sure. get into a relationship every great artist and tweeter's demise started the moment they found love and happiness. examples of this are many and wide-reaching, including, but not limited to: future, nayvadius cash, future hendrix, astronaut kid and super future. get out there on christian mingle! find a life mate and start your transformation into an anthropomorphized laundromat. have a child adopting or making a child the old fashioned way is a game genie for washedness. jay z went from the epitome of cool to whatever this is and this and this, oh, and also this. your entire life gets consumed by responsibility and you are forced to channel your remaining dwindling reserves of care on a baby. soon, you cannot hold a conversation without talking about your baby. your social media feeds are now only about your baby. eventually, you devolve and become a baby yourself. don t care that you are washed take pride in itlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll sorry, i dozed off for a second there. i am so washed! lol! i don't really care about finishing this piece because the current time of me writing this is 5:25pm and it's way past my bed time. goodnight, my babies. footnotes:   for the record, the author has done much sex.

if you go to places like gq or esquire, you can find out about all sorts of ridiculous cocktails with $60 whiskey in them garnished with some herb that no one who isn't a mixologist or a dweeb actually knows about. and that's bullshit. this is a site about clothes. the more money you're spending on fancy cocktails, the less money you're spending on alphets. as a certified dude who writes for a vaguely fashion-related site, i'm not going to let that shit stand. much like choosing which fabrics to drape yourself in every morning, you should be creative in how you decide to get drunk this summer. but, again, since this is a website about fashion, you shouldn't be spending very much money on it. so, i put on my mixologist fedora, went to the bodega across the street from my apartment and created some delicious cocktails to waste your life, but not your savings, with. drew millard wrote this while gone off those four pins comments. you can read more of his work on noisey and follow him on twitter here.         everyone talks about thots, but it's almost always designated to just women. not to get all r/mensrights on you, but it's about time we acknowledge the plight of the male thot. no one is fostering young male thots and teaching them the ways of proper male thotsmanship, but that's why i'm here. even though i'm on my 2015 serial monogamist shit and currently wifed up, i had a 2014 male thot phase that made me who i am today and despite being in a relationship, i have still done my best to retain the male thot aesthetic. being a male thot is a full-time job and it's one that both costs you and doesn't pay. it's not really a sustainable career so you should probably also get a separate job, but when you're not doing that, focus all your energy on being the best male thot you can be. be a hyphenate having just one career is for the celibate. be at least 5 different kinds of useless. a true male thot should consider himself an actor-producer-rapper-curator-model-artist-dj, even though that probably just means you're a barista-bartender. no matter the hyphenate combo, always include dj. be popping online being a thot is an art and your canvas is instagram. post flattering selfies with self-deprecating fake humble captions that make it look like you don't even care and then delete it if it gets less than 50 likes. male feminism mention how much of a nice guy male feminist you are and how you hate straight white men, but you're one of the good ones. tell her about how you check your privilege. tell her about how you're not one of these scumbags who lies to have a lot of sex. she'll love it! the guest list wherever you are, always be on the guest list and always talk about it. like, a lot. you didn't pay to get in here! but this is a chipotle, she might say. exactly. pretty cool huh? drink tickets finesse the drink ticket plug. know the dj or be the dj because paying for drinks is for suckers. if you're at chipotle, get a water cup and steal soda. wardrobe come through in a hoodie without a shirt. i recently copped the cabo san lucas hoodie seen above from goodwill for $5. it's already such a quintessential male thot move, but if you throw cabo into the mix, you're at peak thot. you look like you just landed from having all the sex at spring break and you're ready to do more. pack heavy (mostly) pack a toothbrush, floss, mouthwash, facial wash, facial toner, cotton balls, q-tips, body wash, shampoo, conditioner, contacts case, contact solution, deodorant, condoms and literally never an extra shirt. spill on yourself as early as possible, accidentally spill wine or sauce on your hoodie. what if i'm not at a restaurant or eating food, you ask? bring your own sauce, ya dummy, and spill it all over your cabo san lucas hoodie. oops, i guess i have to take this off, you say. brandon, you have friggin' nice muscles. your hot bod makes me so dang horny, she'll respond. actually, make your own sauce now that i think about it, don't just bring your own sauce, make your own. before he started selling his signature donkey sauce at his times square restaurant, known male thot guy fieri spent years inviting girls to try his sauce and he has a well-known 100% success rate. don't have your own place raise the stakes! your motivation for being a male thot will be a lot higher if you're fucking for shelter. the longer you keep your own place, the longer you're keeping a safety net you know you can jack off in. nope, not anymore! brandon wardell is a comedian and writer living in los angeles. he raps with drew millard under the name nice boys. their mixtape, yeezus 2, drops this summer. he's available to dj under the name teen party. you can follow him on twitter here.         lately, everyone seems to be hell bent on getting turnt (see also: up, turnt; turnip; up, turn). but, is it really all that it's made out to be? is feeling like imminent death an ideal way to spend your saturday morning/afternoon/evening? has looking at your text messages from the previous night become a painfully shameful thing to do? does spending a gratuitous amount of your hard-earned money on low-grade poison the best way to socialize with your friends? sometimes, you just need some me time: an evening free of well whiskey shots and prescription stimulants. you may just need to ask yourself, turn up for what? here are a handful of helpful suggestions to support your rejection of wanting to get weird queries. nickolaus sugai is staying in tonight. follow him on twitter here.         look, i know i don't need to tell you this, but you're fat, man. while your not-fat friends spend time playing racquetball and participating in organized fleeing (aka jogging), or whatever else regular sized people do to maintain their physiques, you were lying around your house in your 4xl basketball shorts playing league of legends, eating cinnabons by the box and drinking gallons of baja blast. rest your quickly and erratically beating heart, fellow fat guy. i am not here to tell you to put down the 'bon and cancel that domino's order and hit the p90x, especially because i'm not sure what that even in exactly. i am here to do what no one did for me when i was a #fatteen. i am going to provide a practical guide for how fat guys should dress themselves. there is no truly helpful guide on how to dress or what kinds of clothes to wear when you're a fat guy because 1. fashion people want you to feel shamed for being shaped like you are and 2. there's inherently less money in fat guy thinkpiece lists. when there are guides on how fat guys should dress, they usually emphasize making you look less fat or their biggest tip is to wear suspenders like you're the nutty professor. i say enough is enough. there's no shame in being fat, but there's also no one out there telling you what you need to know when it comes to clothing yourself. let's change that. [lead image via pop revolver] andrew winistorfer is famous for being the fat kid who loves cake that 50 cent mentioned on 21 questions. he lives in madison, wisconsin and he's on twitter here.          imagine that you find yourself in a cavernous convention hall. thousands of strangers press in on you from every side, sucking short breaths through open mouths and staring, unblinkingly, into the air in front of your face. a rough grey carpet snatches at your shoes and you realize you're sweating not drips, but in a wave that washes across your forehead like a tide wandering into an overgrown bay. you close your eyes, blanching in the piercing glare of afternoon sunlight. the darkness soothes you and you naturally contemplate your own mortality. but how? you wonder, gritting your teeth and clasping your brow. how ever will i manage to die in this crowded room? so glad you asked, dear reader. it's not the purpose of this guide to instruct you how to die. that's on you. merely dying is easy and when your time comes you will likely have little to no trouble doing so. no, these instructions are intended for those who, either by personal choice or due to fate's unknown designs, absolutely must meet their end while trapped inside a man-made structure infested by a dense, smiling throng of fellow man. this is a trickier demise, one that will require brilliant choreography, delicate wit and graceful flourish to bring off without a hitch. in many ways, expiring in a large house party or packed restaurant is more difficult than surviving one. but don't despair! we've created this handy, step-by-step guide to help you navigate any cacophonous, overpopulated delta that stands between your clammy body and death's clement mouth-kiss. when properly applied, it boasts a staggering rate of success, so please treat its techniques with deadly respect. cool? cool. this is the four pins guide to dying in a crowded room.

i don't know. maybe you haven't. let s create a hypothetical universe where you do deserve to routinely destroy your body's vital organs. and what a universe it is! and what a person you are! a good person? debatable. a person? definitely! even a garbage piece of shit person is still a person, they just have a few added adjectives in front of the word person. okay, so here are some hangover cures in case you're a big baby. brendan o'hare is attempting to be a writer and comedian while living in nyc. follow his comedy jokes on twitter here.         in april 2015, the 2004 volkswagen jetta i was gifted as a hand-me-down from my parents that i drove cross country from dc to la a year prior died on me. before this, it had been a problem car that i kept sinking money into every few months and by the time the check engine light came on for the last time around january 2015, my solution was ignoring it until it went away. eventually, the check engine light turned off, but so did the engine. that same week, my friend had mentioned his car lease ending and that his plan was to go full uber. during the uberpool beta period, he copped a $5 ride from silver lake to malibu, which if you look at a map, is fucking insane. once i heard that, i was down. not to mention, i was at a place where a) i couldn't buy a car i'd actually want, b) i could lease a car i'd want but, like, i didn't wanna make an effort to find out how that worked and c) fuck taking the bus literally ever. i'm sure there are some convenient routes if you plan it right or whatever, but idc idc idc. i just can't. i mean, fuck, i have a wikipedia page and hit tweets, i can't ride the bus, you guys. you're both being graded if you're used to being a psycho when driven by taxi drivers you won't ever see again, chill and, also, why the fuck are you taking a taxi in 2015? are you taking that taxi to a blockbuster? did you call it on a payphone? what's wrong with you? anyway, you rate uber drivers on a scale of 1-5 stars, but they also rate you back. if you only use uber for being drunk and/or going to the airport, whatever, but if it's the way you get around in life, you gotta keep your stats up. there's literally leagues to this shit: if a driver is a 4.9 and you're a 4.2, they're prolly not gonna pick you up. so, ya know, don't be late or a dick and you're good. i kiss ass heavy and so do they, so no matter how silent the ride was, when i get off, one of us hits the other with a, hey buddy, 5 stars! aux cord privileges drivers are almost always down to pass the aux or give you that bluetooth connect, but it's also important to know your audience. i've only been listening to future's dirty sprite 2, but when i hopped in an uber where the driver was an old man who was literally bumping beethoven, i knew that was a situation where i had to fall back. uber aux cord djing is an art and it can be euphoric. yesterday, i belted can't feel my face with a 50-something named aarman. the first time i was on molly, it kicked in while i was in a car with two friends and a hype young driver who was going fucking crazy to the same music as us and it made the moment that much more special, especially because, again, i was on molly. when i lived in dc, i took public transit a lot and when i was driving solo all the time my first year in la, i sometimes missed how much you experience being surrounded by strangers. uber is a nice compromise wherein you feel connected with one stranger in a beautiful way without being on some dang dirty death machine. music only heightens the moment. as does molly. know when to uberpool uberpool is the carpool feature wherein there's an already set cheap ass price to your destination, just with the sacrifice of getting another passenger on the way or, sometimes, there's already a passenger. if that's the case, it'll tell you and you should cancel right away and find another one. the reason why uberpool is dope is half the time you don't get another passenger and you just end up getting a cheaper uberx. it only goes to certain neighborhoods, but all of the ones worth being in. for example, uberpool doesn't go to the valley, but you shouldn't either. for the most part, if i'm close to somewhere and good on time, uberpool is my default. if you're running late, don't risk it. i was cutting it close on getting to the airport, but because i'm a cheap idiot, i hit uberpool. not only did i almost miss my flight, but the driver had none of the aforementioned aux cord or bluetooth capabilities, only coming equipped a cd player and radio, which, in case you didn't know, is how people who are dead now used to listen to music. shit might've as well be a horse and buggy at that point. not to mention, i shared the ride with two young teen brothers who kept calling each other brother, like buster bluth or a mormon. then, sexual healing came on the radio as i sat with these two terrifying weirdos in the middle of an airport anxiety attack. taking an uberx for literally 3-5 more dollars would have been the move in retrospect. be sponsored by uber andy milonakis tweets about uber a lot. eventually, uber noticed and now every uber ride he takes is free. so, like, if anyone at uber is reading this, holler at ya boy. by the way, feel free to use my uber code.

[lead image via the guardian] use your paws to follow drew millard on twitter here.         something is in the air, my friends. and that something is the vestigial hair of dudes everywhere, tied up and in bun form. in the past few months, man buns have gone from something that only irrelevant hippies wore to hot yoga to a trend that was certified by the fact that the the new york times wrote about them being a trend, the awl posted a photo essay about them and new york magazine linked to the awl's photo essay about them. in the business , this is what we call the triple salchow of fuccboidom. now that man buns are ubiquitous (in fashion, ubiquitous means relatively common in los angeles and new york), they are both simultaneous so over and only just begun. while actually fashionable dudes will probably abandon the man bun pretty soon and grow man-pigtails or man-shave their man-heads, normal human males are coming to realize that the man bun is the easiest hairstyle to have that still counts as fashion. there is no gelling, combing or, if you wanna get real freaky with it, washing required to maintain a man bun. instead, there are just two simple steps: 1. grow a large amount of hair. 2. put said hair in bun. boom. fashion. motherfucker. are you ready for a man bun? of course you are! i grew a man bun and decided to monetize my hairstyle by writing this guide to man bun grooming. when you get a man bun, you have to decide whether or not you're going to be ambitious and grow a shit ton of hair, or if you want to grow a medium amount of hair and then get the sides of your head shaved so you can put the rest in a mini-bun on top. i opted for the second option, because i am wildly impatient. once you get your man bun, it's time to start wearing it in the wild. your friends will probably make fun of you at first, but those people are either jealous, bald, not your real friends or jealous bald people who are not your real friends. this is fine. the man bun has a bad rep in society because the celebrity most associated with it is jared leto, whose brand is both bad actor and bad mainstream rock. but the man bun is glorious and it is your job, four pins reader, to take back the man bun. man buns are great. they make you smarter, render you impervious to pain, strengthen your lovemaking ability, allow you to speak several languages fluently, protect you from smelling farts on the subway, give you a place to hold a pencil in your hair and are divisive enough to make someone love or hate you immediately. the ultimate form of the shmoney dance involves growing a man bun, then cutting it off and throwing it in the air. you know all of this is true because you read it on the internet. there are countless varieties of man buns out there and you need to know which type of man bun is right for you. with that in mind, i googled a bunch of pictures of man buns and decided to name all of their different phenotypes. please click through the slideshow above to enjoy the remainder of this man bun-related #content. drew millard wrote this while wearing a baewear t-shirt with his own face on it. you can read more of his work on noisey and follow him on twitter here.         was this your first or second market week?

you ve been blogging for a year or two now, picking out only the coolest pictures to post on the internet. you ve noticed that all the new stores and brands are selling the same thing and why isn t someone carrying this crazy awesome obscure japanese label that won t let you take photos of their garments or sell them using anything other than the barter system? and thank god you never posted from your secret inspiration folder. you know why? because it s time you start your own brand, that's why! or open your own store! you ve been day dreaming about it for years now and it's time to pull the motherfucking trigger. as any small business loan officer will tell you, it's not that easy. see, that's where we come in. we've got your back assuming you'll hook it up with a discount, or free shit if that's easier, of course. so, without further ado, here's our patented a guide to starting your own brand. we're finna help you drop the hammer of justice on these jokers.         1. friendly trash talk should be encouraged. something like, mike? week 5? you're going down, pal, or hey, mike. i know where you live. i know where you work, or even mike, i'm coming to murder you tonight while you sleep. football. trash talk livens up the league and makes your match-ups that much more exciting. 2. make sure you know your league rules, as some players will hold more worth depending on the scoring system. for instance, in a league where backbreaking interceptions and hilarious facial expressions are highly valued, eli manning is a surefire first round pick. 3. ppr leagues are becoming more and more popular in the fantasy world. ppr, of course, stands for points per rapscallion, encouraging players to draft the nfl's most mischievous scamps and ne'er-do-wells. 4. arrive about an hour late to your draft. this power move will show your fellow managers that you aren't messing around. wow, they'll all definitely say for sure, this guy must be good. he doesn't even need to be on time. 5. don't get sucked in just because everyone else is drafting qbs or tes. you actually don't need to draft those players at all. you can pick whomever you want. nothing matters. life is meaningless. 6. some important terms to know: average draft position, idp, injured reserve, football, pigskin, score, football score, what's the score in the game, which one is the team i want to win, did my player get any points, is it good that he did that, sleeper. 7. players to watch: jamaal charles, adrian peterson, peyton manning, demaryius thomas, calvin johnson, dez bryant. if you manage to get all of these guys on your team, look out, you might just do some damage! 8. players to avoid: terry bradshaw, jerry rice, johnny unitas, elroy crazy legs hirsch, shane falco. these players are all retired, dead or fictional. 9. if another manager refuses to accept your trade request, throw in your best player. he'll definitely go for it then. congratulations, you've made a trade! 10. if you don't pay attention to bye weeks, then you can say bye to any chance of winning your league! 11. if you don't pay attention to the waiver wire, then you can waive goodbye to any chance of winning your league! 12. if you don't pay attention to a player's average draft position, then you can average draft position to any chance of winning your league! 13. you may have heard of snake drafts before. they have nothing to do with fantasy football. in this draft you pick the coolest snakes and the winner is decided based on who has the coolest snakes. 14. fantasy football? what is this, game of thrones? i said, what is this, game of thrones? 15. if a player on your team performs poorly, let them know by tweeting angry, incoherent nonsense at them. they will play better next time because of this. 16. ruining drafts, mock or otherwise, is childish buffoonery. grow up. 17. name your team the pigskin padres. there are two p's in a row. 18. just basically pick anyone you want. you'll probably come 5th. stefan j. is a writer living in vancouver. you can read his personal blog here and follow him on twitter here.         everybody dust off your cufflinks and get out your hallmark frequent shopper card, spring is fully sprung and bitches are getting married. like the swallows of san juan capistrano, every year around this time young people flock to the same banquet halls and event spaces to witness their friends partake in the sacred ritual of holy matrimony. and like the priests of the san juan capistrano mission, they do so by getting shitfaced in formal wear and dancing to  too close  by next. are you feeling less than inspired by the prospect of another spring spent celebrating someone else's life decisions? not terribly thrilled to toast to a union that will statistically end in divorce and anecdotally end in the crippling realization that life as you know it is over forever? lighten up, guys! a wedding presents all of the makings of a fantastic evening, especially if you aren t the one getting married. let's go over some simple tips to help maximize the experience. steve dool is a writer based in new york city. follow him on twitter.         coachella is like an asshole everyone has an opinion about it! that s how that saying goes, right? the annual two weekend music festival in indio, california inspires enough ire that making fun of coachella has become almost as much a tradition as the concert itself. the only thing that might set the snarkiest corners of the internet more ablaze would be if anne hathaway were to introduce each act with a painfully earnest speech about the beauty and honesty of live performance.  don t get any ideas, fantine! however, as someone who went last year and will soon board a six hour flight to palm springs with a suitcase full of recently un-space bagged shorts, i am here to tell you that despite what you may read, a weekend at coachella can actually be a lot of fun, provided, of course, that you aren t a total dickbag while you re there. trust me, there will be more than enough dickbags in attendance to make up for your lack of dickbaginess, so please check your dickbagish behavior at the dickbagishly long security lines. need help with all that? here are some tips just for you, dickbag. steve dool is a writer based in new york city. follow him on twitter.         father's day is this sunday, but you probably already know that because you've probably already gotten about fifteen emails about some great gifts for dad. like all children, you will take your dad out to brunch or something on sunday, get him a lotto ticket and call it a day. father's day, and all the shitty gifts that it has begotten, is like a national holiday for the remembrance of disappointing your dad. and if we are experts at anything here at four pins, it's disappointing our dads. so, in lieu of a boring ass father's day gift guide that nobody wants to read, we are more than pleased to bring you, the four pins guide to disappointing your dad.         americans drive cars. there are only a few cities in america where you don't need a car. one of those cities invented uber, another has 50,000 taxis and the other has a convenient above ground train. even if you don't own a car, americans are in cars all the time. in fact, i'm writing this right now from an office building in woodland hills, ca overlooking the 101. it's 11:26am on a thursday and the freeway is crawling. traffic makes no fucking sense at all and just pisses everyone off. one time i asked my friend what the hell was up with all those times you hit traffic, the traffic clears and you see no reason for the traffic in the first place (e.g. no accident, lane closure, etc). he replied, something about an accordion. a single tear rolled down my cheek as his poetic statement cleared up years of confusion. regardless, here are some tips to leans out of car window, shakes fist furiously, beings to shout learn how to fucking drive, you asshole. robesman is a brand who drives 40 miles every day on the 101 in los angeles for work. tweet him when he's stuck in traffic.         do you have a problem when it comes to buying clothes? it's hard to admit to yourself that you're a barely functioning jawnz addict. and believe me, i know. it took several years of denial and overdue credit card bills before i even began to even realize that there might be a problem. people were always all up in my business, asking me in accusatory tones, you got another new shirt? to which i always responded in a rash manner, fuck you. no i didn't. can i live? these days, i acknowledge i have a problem. and it's bad. but if i keep it together at work and do a good job hiding my addiction, like any other addict, i can still lead a fairly productive life. sure, i can't always afford my cable bill, but i'm still draped in rare hemlines and my loved ones are foolishly led to believe that i've cut back on the shopping. how did i accomplish this feat of having my poncho and wearing it too? i've learned how to effectively lie to everyone in my life about my clothing addiction. follow these instructions and soon you will too.         aye, what's really good, dawg? how you been? good though?

she's all tight at me because i accidentally knocked her tray over while trying to take a selfie with my boy's mixed media graffiti canvas t-shirt earlier. whatever. get a real job, amirite? anyway listen, you've been doing some really tasteful shit recently really growing the brand organically, making it a fucking lifestyle and shit. i see you, playboy. as someone who's been out here grinding for a minute, i have nothing but respect for the hustle. but yo, to take your movement to the next level and make it really pop off, you gotta step your fucking game up. you're probably wondering how to do it, right?

and, at this point, it s probably easier than becoming a menswear guru because, while there is an army of cads online and off to dissect why trad is the old plaid is the new rad, no one has any fucking idea what to do with, like, a blonde wigged-naked doll whose legs have been re-purposed into a nutcracker. that was actually a real thing. also, art is hilarious. like seriously, an artist is going to have the national perform the same song for six hours at ps1 in may. that's the kind of shit we re dealing with here, people. my credentials, you ask?

most likely. do you have reserves of enthusiasm? do you like to do things? well, with a few tweaks to your normal routine you can stop being a dumbass lame and become cool for once in your life. here is the four pins guide to being washed. go to sleep early getting a good night sleep is essential to being washed. if you are going to miss out on every surprise album release and seminal pop culture moment then start passing out moments after dusk. you'll have to adjust your meal times to maintain this long-term, but having supper alone at 4:00pm at applebee's is actually very lit and affordable. plus, you can get the 2 for $20 deal and not have to share the 'tizer. fall asleep during tv shows and movies between all the sleeping, you won't have much time to stay abreast of important entertainment and with the advent of dvrs and netflix it's nearly impossible to have an excuse for why you have never seen game of thrones. the only two options for you are: 1. tell people, i actually don't own a tv, but then you go from being washed (and cool) to being an untouchable. 2. fall asleep while watching them so you have the excuse that you are getting caught up. i have dozed off during john woo's 1992 classic hard boiled three times in the last 7 days. i haven't even made it past 30 minutes. since i'm not sure exactly at what point i fell asleep, i have to start back at the beginning each time. i fell asleep during true detective's fourth episode and didn't even know it. i started watching last week's episode and realized i had no clue what was going on. i had to go back and rewatch, but i fell asleep again. i may never actually finish this season and i'm okay with that realization. i mean, i never planned to. shit sucks. be tired all the time despite being rested did you really think that just because you got 14 hours of sleep that you were supposed to be energized? no, you are still going to be tired because you got too much sleep, which makes you need more sleep. it's a lovely perm press cycle. start taking vitamins vitamins are actually very cool. the way they just eliminate free radicals and stop inflammation in your joints when the barometric pressure drops below 30 >>>>>>.  you don't have to be swaggerless and nibble on some flintstones chewables. get creative! buttchug some melted down krill oil. maybe even pour a four of centrum liquid in a 2-liter of sprite #sponsored.  about to smoke a glucosamine blunt i'm so washed   roc (@rocmodernlife) july 19, 2015  don't finish any beer you ever order this sounds wasteful, but it's not intentional. a few swigs of alcohol will make you tired. (and you are, remember? you are sleeping 14 hours a day. what are you even doing out at a bar/restaurant ordering a beer?) you won't even be able to make it all the way through that hoppy ipa before feeling like you need a quick 4 hour catnap. never go outside earl tried to tell you, but you didn't listen. outside is trash. inside is classic. since you are taking all those aforementioned vitamins, you don't need to rely on the sun for vitamin d. and since i wrote that sentence as a segue for me to talk about how the sun is garbage, let's talk about how the sun is garbage: first, it is unnecessarily hot. second, you can't even look directly at it without it harming you like a basilisk. third, the baby from teletubbies was creepy and haunts my dreams to this day. without an actual sun, he doesn't exist. fourth, its cartoon depiction always has it wearing sunglasses like some chill bro, but since it is the sun, it doesn't need shelter from its own light or need to protect it's stupid hydrogen eyes from its own uv rays. seriously, sheeple, wake the fuck up. why is the government trying so hard to convince us that the sun is cool? fuck the sun. there is literally no reason to ever leave your home. stop doing things altogether don't do things. ever. even if something sounds like fun, don't. the concept of fun should repulse you. the idea of having to go anywhere outside of your abode should fill you with so much anxiety that you collapse on the bathroom floor and shake for several hours. once your body has softened from atrophy, it will be difficult to do things anyways. your body will hurt for no reason. if you even look at a basketball, you'll pull a groin muscle. god forbid you actually play a game of pick-up. still make plans to do things, though. remember, we are going for washed not leper. give non-answers to all invites. for example: coworker: want to hit happy hour with us after work? you: conceivably.  friend: we're fam building at beloved this saturday, you in? you: i'll see if i can swing it.  mom: your grandmother's funeral is tomorrow. can you be a pallbearer? you: perchance. after enough times, there will be a tacit understanding that you will not be at anything ever and people will stop asking. don't do anything in a timely manner i sent lawrence the pitch for this article on june 2, 2015. i was too busy sleeping and hating myself to get it done until now. do i care? as long as that sweet $20 check from complex clears, nope. lose interest in your passions part of achieving this will happen naturally because you won't have as much time to stay on top of things that you care about. however, there are still those pesky 10 hours when you aren't sleeping and you may be tempted to read an internet website. though i wouldn t recommend that, it's okay because you quickly realize how out of touch you are and subsequently abandon it completely out of frustration. i used to design and install home theaters and lighting control systems...but that that was before the war...things are different now. i have no clue what a 4k tv is. i am genuinely frightened of curved televisions. i used to be an early adopter. i used to understand and love technology. i am now confused by snapchat. rebuke youth culture once you are truly out of touch with the world, you will become angry, angry at the freedom that others have, specifically the youth and, like, whatever the hell it is they are doing. their innovation scares you. their happiness befuddles you. their exuberance vexes you. i am personally scared of all teens because i know at a moment's notice they could reduce me from man to meme in a viral second. maybe they invented a new bofa approach i'm not aware of? maybe they make me the star of a popular vine? maybe one of them straight up tweets me that i'm a cell phone hip case wearing aaron carter with a pituitary gland problem face ass lookin boy. to all cool teens , please do not own me on the web. i beg you. spend a few hours a week shouting at some stupid altostratus to keep your vocal cords warm for when you need to tell some children to get off your lawn. the world was a better place when you were growing up, that's for damn sure. get into a relationship every great artist and tweeter's demise started the moment they found love and happiness. examples of this are many and wide-reaching, including, but not limited to: future, nayvadius cash, future hendrix, astronaut kid and super future. get out there on christian mingle! find a life mate and start your transformation into an anthropomorphized laundromat. have a child adopting or making a child the old fashioned way is a game genie for washedness. jay z went from the epitome of cool to whatever this is and this and this, oh, and also this. your entire life gets consumed by responsibility and you are forced to channel your remaining dwindling reserves of care on a baby. soon, you cannot hold a conversation without talking about your baby. your social media feeds are now only about your baby. eventually, you devolve and become a baby yourself. don t care that you are washed take pride in itlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll sorry, i dozed off for a second there. i am so washed! lol! i don't really care about finishing this piece because the current time of me writing this is 5:25pm and it's way past my bed time. goodnight, my babies. footnotes:   for the record, the author has done much sex.

built a brand with fervent followers and a knack for giving the people what they want. while john elliott + co. burst on to the scene less than three years ago, the build up was longer and more perilous than simply designing the game-changing hoodies with side zippers or the perfectly tapered sweatpants readers of this site, and many others, lose their collective shit over. the brand itself is a product of john's ability to look at things a little bit differently. john is a child of early '90s san francisco, a skateboard-heavy city where, at the time, the diy culture amongst the skate community manifested itself in kids starting their own businesses to solve their own problems. this inspiration to resolve one's own dilemmas continues to drive john's creative process today, partly due to those early years. severe dyslexia hampered his education and forced him into non-traditional career paths. as a result, fashion became the plan, so to speak. i don't really buy into admitting it, he says. but finding out you have a learning disability at a young age, you get classified as different. i knew i had trouble reading and spelling, and it made me feel i had to overcome through other means. art and design were an outlet for me a way to daydream and escape the reality that school was tough for me. still, john attended college and once he graduated, returned to san francisco to work at one of his favorite stores, villains on the city's iconic haight street. talk to john for any amount and he constantly touches on the concept of timing. his father always told him the timing had to be right for him to get into a new opportunity. while timing factors into the development of many brands, it perhaps affected john elliott + co. more than most. in around 2004, menswear began to carve out a true corner of the web for itself, establishing that it wasn't going away. streetwear was in the midst of experiencing a huge revival, hypebeast was churning out more content that ever and even one of john's friends, who taught english in japan, flipped items from companies like bape online. the timing couldn't have been any better. i wanted to infiltrate that world and be involved, he says. i saw brands like nom de guerre and their shop and the experience of tight curation. it really affected me. with a few years at villains under his belt, john met two ex-silicon valley vets who bought a clothing store, jack's, and brought him on as both manager and head buyer. the job became his fashion crash course. they had no experience in fashion, he says. but they were smart businessmen and this was all i ever wanted to do. the advice from my dad was always, 'get in the best situation to succeed because you're only going to get one shot.' so the plan was to learn the industry through experience. it was like school for me. built upon an aesthetic john single-handedly cultivated as buyer, jack's took off and eventually opened a second location in san francisco. in the course of his duties, he made a visit to the simon miller showroom in los angeles in 2007 and was struck by intricate denim details. before raw denim became the trend du jour, and in the era of rock & republic, here was a clean, minimal denim line. there was a lot of 'back pocket bullshit' at the time, he says in reference to the ornate branding boom seen on jean pockets at the time. that shit was cool for a minute and guys bought into it, but simon's jeans were completely different than what was in the marketplace. i had to sell the guys [at jack's] on the brand and when we brought it in, it sold really well. as jack's grew, john bounced around. he left his post there and moved down to l.a. for wholesale work. he stayed on his best friend, aaron lavee's floor for a year and sold off extra clothes and shoes to build up the funds to start what would eventually become john elliott + co. eventually, aaron became a partner and the two pooled together $30,000 between them a pittance compared to a typical clothing brand's start-up costs. from these, it was pure fucking hustle (and not the type where you send networking emails while listening to the latest drake). john quit his wholesale gig and helped rob garcia, whom he'd become good friends with while in college at sdsu, during the early days of en noir. simultaneously, he worked tirelessly with simon miller to learn the intricacies of garment construction. for a year and a half, he was the proverbial sponge, albeit an incredibly broke sponge. all the while, he started to build the foundation of john elliott + co. i worked my ass off and told myself each day that it was one less day and kept the ultimate goal in mind, he says. that was the most exhilarating part of my life. i had no money and was left to my own devices. there was a lot of self-questioning. i knew if i wanted to change course, i could get a job. but there's this thing that bugs you about giving up on the dream you'd worked so hard for. i try to avoid the 'i design sweatpants' conversation. i prefer to let others do the labeling for me. through connections at simon miller, john built the blueprint for his own signature denim: a hybrid mix and match of his favorite aspects from other jeans. he constantly showed up at the fabric brand offices, a japanese denim company, to meet with nobu yamamoto and learn more about the denim industry. through him, john got his hands on samples and began frankenstein-ing jeans and working with a pattern maker. i was starving and would show up at people's offices everyday, he says. i begged nobu to teach me about japanese denim. i thought i had decent knowledge, but he was on a whole other level, like master yoda. john ran around l.a. and established relationships with wash shops to create the perfect jean. to create his signature knits, he kept with the denim inspiration and chose french terry for its similarity to denim: it fades with wear, conforms to the wearer's body and maintains a structure other knits don't. from the start, fabrication became a mainstay. with his northern california diy skater mentality firmly in the forefront of his mind, details like side zippers and interior kangaroo pockets helped separate john's designs from the pack. but the big break was, not surprisingly, a function of timing. in las vegas in 2012, as rob showed the new en noir collection to buyers in his hotel room, john brought four pairs of jeans with him. based on the strength of just two pairs of raw and washed denim respectively, he set up a meeting with atrium in new york. a week later, john and aaron were in the basement of atrium to show the collection. the rep is going through the collection and pulls out the villain crew and goes, 'what are you doing with this?' he says. at the same time, this kid salesman walks down the stairs, sees it and goes, 'what is that?!' he tries it on, unzips the sides and sees the kangaroo pocket. i swear his mind melted out his ears. that was the moment that changed my life. atrium placed an order immediately and john leveraged the name to place the first john elliott + co. collection in 11 stores across the country, selling out in all of them on the back of little press and some minor instagram buzz. a brand was born. now, less than two years later, john has worked to carefully expand the collection without alienating the fanbase that helped create it. he wants to keep that teenager who originally shit his pants over the villain on board for the long haul, and hopefully in head-to-toe john elliott. the line is designed to be worn and layered all together, he says. that means more materials, new colors and updated versions of previous designs. the mesh rebel hoodie joined the catalog earlier this year partly based on inspiration from john's love of basketball he's been known to wear jerseys underneath his shirts with more mesh pieces than ever incorporated into the s/s 15 collection. the original mercer tank transformed into the mercer tee due to a groundswell of customer requests and quickly became a best seller. new fabric blends are not planned or forecasted as much as they organically resemble experiments gone right for instance, silk blend tees. while his designs have taken shape over the seasons, he continues to design for himself. fortunately, the pieces possess a style that's immediately connected with a devoted section of the menswear masses. but classifying the john elliott aesthetic along the fashion spectrum isn't easy. in fact, that may be the beauty of the whole thing. while sweats remain the sunday uniform for out of shape dudes with 12 straight hours of football on deck, john doesn't believe they're relegated to the sofa anymore. the substantial knits and slim cut aren't your dad's mustard-stained walmart specials. i don t think i'm too unique as denim, french terry and jersey cotton is my uniform, he says. but the culture has changed and these fabrics are more acceptable as work attire, so guys can justify spending more on them. as the first iterations began with basic french terry hoodies, sweats and well-crafted denim, the new collections show the designer and his eponymous line's progression in such a short amount of time. insane leather jackets, 42 inseam sweats (we still can't get over those, guys), premium work shirts, crews with sleeve pockets, supima cotton mesh shirts and jogging tights all make future appearances. john elliott + co. is no longer just men's basics, as he's said in the past. i try to avoid the 'i design sweatpants' conversation. i prefer to let others do the labeling for me, he says. his most recent collection shows that the new john elliott doesn't leave his roots behind, but wants to show how much better it can be.         after six years, i've ended one of the most meaningful relationships of my life. our love affair started small. she was vast and i didn't know what to do with her. but soon she opened my eyes to a world of gifs, boobs, #menswear and vintage basketball cards. we talked almost daily. when there was nothing to do, she was always there with a self-esteem boosting note or anonymous message. she introduced me to a few good friends, a couple of great connections and helped get my projects in front of teens with credit cards. but as i aged, i found myself turning to her less and less, and finally last week, i had to end it. i had to delete my tumblr. it's all good though, bros. we accept that every social media platform has a shelf life. kids want to be on the apps their parents don't have. old people want to be where the hip kids are. forever we migrate. but tumblr was pretty special. a perfect balance of semi-anonymity, ease of use and add speed image saturation made the site the go-to for huge number of youngish folks of myriad subculture affiliations. but how do you see how many followers other people have? asked a coworker who is heavy into the 'gram, but ignorant of tumblr mechanics. you can't, i replied. that's so weird, she said. that's exactly what makes it great, i replied definitively. i'm no stranger to the gpoy, but i always liked tumblr for avoiding the narcissistic thirst traps of other sites. particularly in the emotionally fragile, vapid world of the fashionz, it's easy to judge yourself by the followings of your peers who are not actually you're peers because they're swagless. on tumblr, i could pretend i was a way bigger deal than i was and nobody could call me out on it. if i mistimed my selfie and bricked in the reblog market, fuck it. onto the next one. the impermanence of the tumblr dashboard was part of its appeal. that rapid pace also helped kill menswear writing for awhile, but ain't nobody got time for your essay on the future of flyknit, and, fair or not, nobody is taken seriously for going longform all up in the dash. i took a yoga breath, exhaled a lion's and said hakuna matata. may the reblogged vestiges of my former blog children echo through the tumblrsphere for years to come. so, why would anyone leave such a utopian cyber community? i'm trying to be productive aka get that bryan boy blog money and ninety percent of the time i'm logging into tumblr it's solely to avoid real, actual work. ok, that's the boring answer. real talk though, bromies, there are too many babes. it just so happens that the dudes who are into posting very rare japanese garments are also into posting very rare thick asian babes and shit. shout to the leftist. with an endless stream of waifs and wifeys of indeterminate ages, tumblr can flip your midday time kill into an awkward workplace boner. i don't need that in my life, man. irl babes got me stressed enough. throwing away a 6-year-old, small, but influential following is a bit of post-modern strug. i know when i post a photo or a project on tumblr, it's likely jon moy will see it and like it and then not write about it on four pins. but my homie steven jobs told me to cannibalize myself release a new iphone every three months even though the old ones are fine. and shit, the tide has turned on the follow game anyway. in 2010, a few thousand followers might have made you legit. these days, your 12-year-old cousin posting shirtless bathroom selfies has 12k on instagram. i want my shit to seem like it's on some rare hemline vibes. anything more than 216 followers is too mainstream for my clique. no, losing my followers didn't hurt the most. it was the 5,000+ images, sick vids and gifs i'd expertly curated over the years. how do you quantify a stellar collection of adorable cats, dope fits and rare m.o.p. cuts? i waffled for a few days before trying two programs supposed capable of ripping all the images off my tumblr, but i was too og to get either to work properly. so, i took a yoga breath, exhaled a lion's and said hakuna matata. may the reblogged vestiges of my former blog children echo through the tumblrsphere for years to come. yes, i'm catching lonely feels in the wake of the breakup, but i know in my heart that deletion was the chillest move. sure, when i screencap hip/obscure foreign comedies, i feel a twinge of regret. where should i post this fly shit? i guess it's back to the days of saving dope images in a fucking folder like it's 2006 or some shit. good thing four pins indulges my every whim and lets me write about the least universal of topics. though my dash may be gone, i still have the energy to manually type in nickelcobalt.tumblr.com every once in awhile to stay up on what's hip with the in-crowd. angelo spagnolo is a writer living in portland, oregon. read his blog here and follow him on twitter here.         lately i feel like i've seen a lot of talk on the internet about sad boys and sad rappers and feelings and whatever the fuck a young lean is, which makes me think that maybe you young motherfuckers are way more in touch with your feelings than literally everyone else on the entire planet. but then, like everything on the internet, i realized sadness is just becoming another fucking meme. so, i figured it's my duty on some older brother type shit to school you depressed goons on what it's like to actually be sad irl. i never knew i had depression. i just thought everyone had really bad anxiety when confronted with new people and new situations. i thought everyone bottled shit up until they had a full-blown breakdown instead of talking about their feelings with their parents or friends or teachers. i used to get such bad stomach aches before high school that i would be doubled over in pain while walking out the door. my mom was freaking out because she thought she made the mistake of sending me to this school that's so rigorous her eldest born was having ulcer symptoms at 14. but it wasn't school, at all. it took a while, but i eventually got used to everything and i'd like to say i kept all my mental issues in check for the next 3 or so years. then i went to college. i was nervous. everyone was smarter than me. everyone had gotten into all the other schools that had rejected me. they had been to europe already. they knew who damien hirst was. my folks came down for parents weekend and, before they left, took me to whole foods to stock up on provisions. i remember they kept asking me if i wanted this or needed that and i just kept saying, yeah, sure. i dunno. probably. we checked out and started loading the groceries into the van. and that's when i lost it. i didn't know how to tell them about the anxiety or the nervousness or the inability to will myself out of bed. now, every time i try and buy some gorilla munch cereal, i think of that time i started sobbing outside the whole foods on north avenue. flash forward to the end of law school. i was losing it again. i think i left my apartment, like, maybe once a week. that's not healthy behavior, my guys. everyone in my life was freaked out. eventually, i watched this documentary on pbs about depression and how it's chronically underdiagnosed in men my age. they had all these dudes talk about their experiences and it was like hearing my own thoughts on television. that was when it hit me. maybe i should talk about this with someone. but there was still some shit on netflix i hadn't watched. it took my parents offering to pay for things before i finally, truly, actually got off my ass and sought help. that as my therapist, she was telling me to cover a menswear trade show an entire city away for a blog that nobody actually read sounds pretty crazy as i type it out, i know. my therapist would always ask me what made me happy. if it wasn't law school, what was it? she wanted to know what i did in my free time. so, i admitted to her that i had started a blog about clothes. she encouraged me to stick with the writing and blogging and i told her i was thinking about going to this trade show called capsule, but i didn't really have any business going and i wouldn't know anyone and what's a fucking blog anyways, so, like, yeah, i probably wasn't going to go. she cut me off right there and said that i had to go. that as my therapist, she was telling me to cover a menswear trade show an entire city away for a blog that nobody actually read sounds pretty crazy as i type it out, i know. like, my therapist is the reason i moved from a dot blogspot to my own url. thank you, doctor yates. if you hadn't told me to go for it i wouldn't be on four pins talking about depression in all caps. always remember to thank your therapist, i guess. despite finally seeking professional help and having tommy ton take my photo every once in a while, shit will still crop up. recently, i've dropped the ball on some professional shit and i need to embrace that. i will go on airplane mode for days at a time. i've straight up disappeared on the team here at four pins. i've ignored much more talented people than myself reaching out to work with me, even offering to pay me to write things. and i don't know why. i still don't know why i just can't answer my phone or email a motherfucker back. i get so anxious even thinking about it. i'm just bummed for no reason for weeks at a time, which sucks because, objectively, i have zero things to be bummed about. i get to create content by my lonely and with a squad. shit is fucking awesome. the shitty thing about being a real sad boy is that you can't control when your sadness will erupt into a mount vesuvius of emotions. for example: remember when nothing was the same first came out and everyone was like, lol wow such dope feels, and how they cried listening to it etc.? yeah, i was like, i don't get it. i like the album, sure, but i don't catch feelings from it. then, one time when i was driving with my girl to my favorite luxe cafe to cop a $4.25 signature latte and some expensive ass toast with bacon jam, too much came on and aubrey said, my uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list/and now he's actin' like 'oh, well, this is life i guess.' and those lyrics hit an echo chamber in my brain and before i knew it was crying while driving in front of my girlfriend. and not like, contemplative, reflective, dignified tears that girls imagine idris elba crying that makes them feel even more sexually and emotionally connected to him. no, i was crying like this. the fucked up thing was that i didn't even know why i was crying. damn, drizzy got bars. my girl handled the whole witnessing her boyfriend losing it to a fucking drake song on the way to buy expensive coffee thing really well and just told me to pull over and take a deep breath. that's when i blurted out, why am i upset? i don't even relate to this song. it's about the heaviness of wealth and success and the effect it's had on drake's personal life. that has nothing to do with my growing anxiety that someone i know and love is going to die imminently. what the fuck!? that's what it's like to be a real sad boy. you ain t about that life unless you actually cry in front of your girlfriend while a drake song plays in the background and have to explain to her that sometimes it feels like when you say goodbye to people it's the last time you might see them because then she'll know you're crazy and it's one thing to suspect your boyfriend is crazy and a whole other thing to have that suspicion confirmed so vividly. do you know how indelibly the image of her boyfriend sobbing like kim kardashian in a late model chevy blazer to a drake song must be stuck in my girlfriend s cranial? but it's cool to be a little crazy, i guess. i read on wikipedia or something that a disproportionate amount of creative geniuses are a little crazy. and i'm pretty sure girls are kinda into geniuses. so ladies, if your man claims that clique, makes sure he's a thoroughbred. oh yeah, and a thug and intelligent too. i'm pretty sure nas said that once.         when news officially broke yesterday that mark anthony green the young gq associate editor and, in the interest of full transparency, friend of four pins and complex would be taking the reins of the iconic, long-standing style guy column, we were as happy for him as we were perplexed. what had happened to the column's originator and author for over 15 years, glenn o'brien? despite o'brien's legendary pedigree writer, critic, first ever editor-at-large, member of warhol's factory, television host to many he was the style guy, making his exit from the most popular and visible men's fashion magazine in the world that much more of a shock. clearly there was a story here, or at least a side to it, that you couldn't get from a press release. despite our penchant for speculation, this particular changing of the guard, so to speak, seemed too monumental to ignore, so we reached out to o'brien directly to get his take. presented below is an exclusive and candid conversation with the man himself in which he opens up about his final days at gq, the end of his style guy column and what the future holds. were you made aware that your time as gq's style guy was coming to an end? did things transpire abruptly or was this the plan all along? first of all, i find the notion that this is a rebranding of the style guy offensive. i created the style guy, not gq. it existed before i went to gq. it had a long run in details. i published a book under that title. it's not something that existed before. it's not like managing editor or film critic. their proprietary attitude toward what i've done is not only insulting, but really unoriginal. they could have at least called their replacement the style intern. my contract was expiring the last day of june. nothing about the future was ever discussed, but then nothing about the future was ever discussed before. i was annoyed that there was no style guy column in the february issue, and that the first time i learned that was when i saw it. then it happened again. i assumed that this had to do with the extraordinary thin-ness of the magazine and not what you might call editorial direction. there wasn't even a masthead in those issues, not to mention a letter from the editor-in-chief. after that there was a disagreement about a feature that jim nelson wanted me to write and he said he wouldn't discuss my contract until it was done, so i simply resigned two months before my contract expired, at the loss of a couple of checks, because things were not handled in a gentlemanly manner. jim nelson acted regretful; he told me his budgets had been slashed and that he could no longer afford me, but he wanted me to continue to write for the magazine. this was not going to happen because of his disingenuous behavior. it was just a year ago when they did an entire special issue of gq style on me. and one year ago, because of my popularity, they wanted me to do the style guy as an animated series on tv for conde nast entertainment, but their tv people were so out of touch and their execution so embarrassing that i refused. the animator made me look like a leprechaun in lipstick. to have had a brilliant success for fifteen years with something i created and then to try to make it appear like suddenly i wasn't modern enough or they needed to go younger is completely dishonest. in fact it is entirely about going cheaper. look at the top contributors over the last several years. look at the editors they've lost. they're all gone. blame it on poor editorial judgment, or corporate mismanagement, or the failure to transition to digital, or the ridiculous moves of their television division, but don't blame me. i would have been happy to just go quietly away from such a vulgar operation, but i am offended at being made a scapegoat for their spectacular incompetence. gentlemen? i don't think so. from your end, was the style guy column something you wanted and intended to write for the foreseeable future? i didn't really think much about the future of the column. i liked having a regular magazine column, which is an increasing rarity, because you have a real audience. that column had a very good audience and it was always, i was told, the most popular feature in the magazine. i knew this from talking to people on the publishing side. i think it was the biggest draw until the very end, although i don't think that would be easy to check at this point. it was partly for that audience that i wrote the book how to be a man, which is a best seller now in its fifth printing. i suppose i thought i would write the column until men ran out of questions or i no longer had one free day a month. the style guy actually began at details and only moved to gq when the former editor of maxim arrived at details for a brief tenure, so it had a very long run. at any point did you feel that your column was out of step with today's fashion trends and the industry's increasing reliance on technology and social media? gq's rebranded style guy 2.0 seems to revolve heavily around integration with twitter and snapchat. i don't know how you know so much about rebranded style guy. do you want to share some press release with me? i saw an announcement on twitter that linked to a column online and i didn't notice anything particularly futuristic or on-point about style guy 2.0. i think that what made my column a success was that it was a rare instance of a magazine allowing a writer to have his own voice. i have never seen eye-to-eye with the fashion department, but i respected their pov, as they did mine and that actually broadened the point of view of the magazine. i was the guy without the tie clip. i think that any magazine that sacrifices the voice of individual writers for a house style is going to be corny and out-of-it. i think that what readers valued about the column was its breadth. i'm not a fashionista. i write mostly about art, but i think the fact that i can write intelligently on many subjects has allowed me to be philosophical and unpredictable. isn't that what the advertisers want? philosophy? i'm kidding. incidentally, i seem to be doing quite well on twitter and instagram. obviously gq had to say something about why i'm not there anymore. snapchat? why not? it sounds better than saying that they're struggling financially, or that when people heard gq they thought of me and not jim nelson. by the way, isn't he getting a little old to be editor of gq? what do you think about the inaugural column? what about mark anthony green, your spiritual successor in all this? do the two of you have a relationship, professional or personal, from your time working together at gq? i don't think he's my spiritual successor. i don't know mark anthony green at all and i don't want to comment on him after reading one rather brief column. over the years i worked with some great people at gq, particularly michael hainey a brilliant editor recently gone at-large adam rapoport who has done a great job at bon app tit and andy comer who has gone over to the fashion world. have you reflected at all on what the end of your column, one that you've been doing for so long, means to you personally? i'm curious as to how you've processed this part of your career and life coming to a close. i love having a regular audience month after month, but i'm sure that my readers and i will find each other. what gq is now is not what i signed up for. it used to be smart and stylish. now they're struggling. they'll save some money since they don't have to pay me and my 15 years of raises, but that won't make up for the fact that now you can slip gq under the door. i have plenty to do. i am writing a major book about how the art world has changed in the last 50 years. i've got a few other books in the works and i write for magazines that smart people read. and i have a secret life in the field of commerce that brings home the bacon. can you talk a little about what you think your column accomplished over its long run and deliver a direct message to your fans and readers who will surely miss both you and your column? what did i accomplish? well i think i see less baseball caps! and i don't know how much i had to do with it, but i see men looking more interesting and fearless, more men looking like stylish individuals and not fashionistas and i love it. if i have fans who miss me you can always find me on twitter and instagram, plus glennobrien.com where you might have to put up with the occasional poem. if you have a question that desperately needs an answer, send it and we'll deal with it gratis via twitter. i can be found in every issue of 10, 10 men and purple, frequently in artforum and another magazine, occasionally in fantastic man and the gentlewoman, and in small independent magazines like bad day, content, paradigm and let's panic. good to be small and independent! several books are on the way. coming this fall, the publication of a play i wrote with the late, great cookie mueller. can't say much now, but there's also tv in the works no, not tv party although the oldies should all be available soon via internet.   demain!  when reached for comment gq editor-in-chief jim nelson said via spokesperson: i don t think about it so much as rebranding style guy as just rethinking it, which you always have to do in magazines, particularly with columns, even the very best of which can get predictable after a while. and glenn's was among the very best. i loved glenn's column, his wit and his take on fashion and style history, for many, many years and he's absolutely right that he has a unique voice. but i thought, after 16 years, it was time for a different perspective on fashion and style. things have changed so much, not the least of which is the way people want information and advice. and i'm interested in style guy moving forward, being in different places, being more responsive to the modern reader, more immediate and helpful. i actually don't think of it so much as a column anymore as an ongoing style conversation with our readers. i think they're hungry for that. [photo via vivian killilea/getty images]         hearing robert geller list the places around the world where he's lived is enough to make anyone want to buy the next available plane ticket to literally anywhere. he spent the first 10 years of his life in hamburg, germany. the next three in los angeles. four years in frankfurt. paris for a year. stuttgart for another. two years as a photo assistant between paris and stuttgart after high school before he attended college at the rhode island school of design, which is in providence if you're keeping track. today, he calls new york city home. we're sitting in his second home, his showroom, on the border between soho and chinatown. it's not one of the streets you end up on if you're just wandering through the neighborhood. it requires a more deliberate effort. maybe it's a metaphor for how his clothing is just far enough off the beaten path of the mainstream for fashion obsessives to admire, yet close enough that it still feels attainable. or maybe that's just the romanticism i've conjured in my head talking thanks to the prospect of talking to one of the faces of four pins' mount rushmore. the rolling racks around us are mostly empty. samples are in japan for sales season now that new york fashion week has wrapped. the always coveted common projects collaborations are piled high in the corner. robert isn't tired though. in fact, he's spritely, even though i'm late because of train delays. he's wearing loose, textured grey sweatpants and a worn in beige shirt. his hair and deliberate stubble give off the vibe of that guy from an art class you took in college that was untouchable when it came time for peer review. robert geller may have actually been that guy if robert geller wasn't already cooler than that guy. throughout his formative years, he thought he was going to be a photographer. his father shot photos professionally for decades and still owns a photography equipment company. he grew up in studios and took after his dad, spending time in darkrooms: i always liked that vibe. i love that atmosphere and i love the fashion aspect of it. from a young age, i was drawn to it, i don't know exactly what it is, but everyone is in a good mood. it's stressful, but there is a vibe there that's creative. he continued on that path to college at risd after two years of photo assistant work before taking a fashion class his freshman year and essentially abandoning photography all together. i came to the point where there were some things frustrating me about fashion photography, robert says. if you want to be creative, you have to assemble a team, you have to have a model, the hair and makeup. you can't just wake up in the middle of the night and be creative. i like with fashion you can wake up, have a pencil and paper and create. even though he was a year or so behind, he took to things fast and was one of two students allowed to interview with marc jacobs for an internship. naturally, he was the one who got the position. marc jacobs was a phenomenon in the early 2000s despite the team running the brand being relatively small. but it was through his time at marc jacobs that robert met russian designer alexandre plokhov, who was working as a pattern maker: we got along really well. we were both into similar designers. it was kitchen talk. we would meet for lunch in the kitchen and talk about what we liked. he told me he had started a company called cloak and had to put it on break while at marc jacobs, but wanted to start it up again. once robert realized that his full-time job prospects at marc jacobs might be slim pickings, the two got to talking, saved up some money and went in together as 50-50 partners on the relaunched cloak. cloak was your favorite brand before your favorite brand existed, an urban blend of gothic, military-inspired clothing that has become a now legendary time capsule moment for the menswear set. robert's time at cloak was largely a learning experience he was only 25 at the time he linked up with plokhov. the brand took home a few accolades during robert's tenure there, including the ecco domani award in 2003 and the cfda/vogue fashion fund in 2004, but without the help of outside financial backing, robert decided to part ways with plokhov and cloak. they pull you in, check you out, circle back around to look at what you're doing and wait to see if you'll be around in a couple seasons and if it's still good. i was learning a lot from him, he says. if you can think of it like a designer and stylist working together, i was more of the stylist, doing the collection colors and themes and the overall look. alexandre was amazing at constructing the garments. there is no one better than him at that than i've met in my life. it was a partnership that created something quite cool. while he wasn't keen on starting a new menswear brand immediately, he founded harald, a small womenswear collection, and applied what he learned from his time at cloak: i had a tiny office on broadway. i did pr, production, the photography and everything on my own. i didn't have fashion shows, didn't have fancy lookbooks. after a couple seasons, robert received a call from japanese production company s.o., which had heard of robert through cloak, with an offer to provide funding for a robert geller menswear label. in its first seasons, robert geller was a success, finding its way into the right stores and the funding to cover its biggest expenses. 2009 saw him win gq s third best new menswear designers in america competition this was when there was still a clear winner that awarded him a capsule collection with levi's, the corporate sponsor at the time. in 2010, he was among ten finalists for the cfda/vogue fashion fund award and in 2011 he won the swarovski award for menswear. he still has those awards sitting a mantle above the racks around us. when i first got into menswear in around 2011 and attempted to read and learn about every single brand that ever existed, as one tends to do, robert geller found me more than i found him. and i guess that was around the time that everyone else did too. he effectively blew up. i think there's an incubation phase of the first three or four seasons where the insiders get to know you, he says. they pull you in, check you out, circle back around to look at what you're doing and wait to see if you'll be around in a couple seasons and if it's still good. now, four years later, nine since the brand began and almost 15 since he first got into fashion professionally, robert geller isn't anybody's darling. he's a veteran. in an industry where almost every other fashion company, well-received or otherwise, eventually folds, geller has made his brand and his look stick. that look is the uniform of so many younger, fashion-conscious guys. while it has shifted and waned slightly, robert geller has stayed a part of the nucleus of brands that own today's look. it's dark, a bit moody, slim, cropped, layered and outfitted with tons of details. we really are going more oversized and creating volume, he says. not that anything has to be super big, but i really like the flowy silhouette a bit oversized with shorter pants. the cropped pants that taper in and stop above the ankles come from soccer warm-up pants. robert himself plays soccer every saturday morning near his office and relates many of his designs back to sports. the silhouette that ruled f/w 15 goes back to the nadi brothers, two italian fencers who ruled the 1920 antwerp olympics, and how they dressed off the piste. talk about specific. this idea of big, luxurious wool coats, they're leaving the gym, their hair is sweaty, but kind of styled, he says. that sort of casual, luxurious elegance that they had back in the day. i was really attracted to that. but this isn't louis vuitton's elegance. it's a toned-down version that relies on deep shades of grey and brown, mixed with flashes of color in the form of those graceful silks. it's a beautiful middle ground between the dystopian tattered uniforms of kanye and adidas' yeezy season 1 (which robert was a consultant on) and his idols raf simons and dries van noten. it's a look that could only be more geller if he branded his name on it. and yet, if you follow him on instagram, you'll see that he doesn't brand himself that much. littered between the fashion shots are photos of his children and wife. just from casual conversation, you can tell robert's a family man first. the ease with which he talks about designing clothing probably comes from the fact that he knows how much harder it is to raise a child than sketch out next season's designs. he may have moved around earlier in life, but his feet are firmly planted in new york. i fell in love here, got married here and love the city, he says. i found my groove and i can't imagine living anywhere else. it feels like my home. we wouldn't have it any other way.         we came across david casavant like we come across everything else: endless browsing on the internet. the nyc-based stylist and collector has one of the foremost archives of insanely rare, collectible, vintage designer clothing. think, raf simons, helmut lang, hedi slimane era dior homme, rick owens, yohji yamamoto and many, many others. his pieces end up on the backs of kanye, rihanna, big sean and plenty of other celebs for appearances and in the pages of countless publications. naturally, we wanted to talk to casavant himself about how he got into collecting and what goes along with owning thousands of grails, so we hit him up to see what he's all about. for starters, let's talk basic, background info. how old are you?  i m 24. and how did you get into collecting?  basically, it started when i was a teenager. i just like clothes, i guess. i started with raf. i really liked his stuff, then i moved onto helmut [lang] and i always just have bought vintage clothes from ebay and consignment stores and thrift stores. i was always sort of collecting in that way. i m a stylist too, so when i was assisting, people would ask me to bring stuff to shoots. i d bring it and eventually was like, i should get credit for this. then i asked for credit and it moved onto renting it out. there are lots of vintage and rental places in new york, but mainly for women s. there s not really a good men s option. so it came from that. so it started off pretty small? yeah, i guess that because i worked in fashion, it made sense to start buying so much. then a couple years ago, i started to think of it more as a business when buying. that s why i ve sort of gone crazy with buying more. how do you track down the pieces? it s sort of a full-time job in a way. it s about being consistent. i check ebay. i go to stores every week. i work with sellers around the world that tell me if they re selling things because i ve been doing it so consistently that i can find pieces at good prices. it s not like i look every once in a while. i guess it s because i buy so much at this point that they just reach out to me first before posting on ebay, which has given me an advantage. also, when i buy something, it s not like it will be a waste of money because i d wear it for fun. but i can justify buying something for more money because i have a whole collection and can treat it as a business purchase. i assume you re into fashion outside of just collecting vintage gear then? do you buy for yourself anymore? i buy more with collecting in mind or think  this could be good for a shoot  if it's a rare piece that would be good to have. obviously, i still like wearing some of it. it has evolved from more of a personal purchase in the beginning to now it s not really about that. do you wear things from your archive still? did you before? or is it more off limits just for loaning out and photoshoots? i have too much to wear it all. i have a lot of weird stuff and some women s. in a way, i treat it as my own personal wardrobe because i like to have it. i keep it all in my apartment with me and i like to be able to have access to it and say,  i want to wear this today.  but it s not really about that anymore. i also don t really do it because i want to look cool while wearing it. i have an actual appreciation for the clothes and view them as it s cheesy to say but a work of art in its own way. how big is your collection now? more than a couple thousand pieces?  honestly. i haven t counted, but a lot. i have thousands of clothes just in my apartment. i just had to move to a bigger place to store them all. i have a whole bedroom for them and another walk-in closet for other stuff and then a vintage closet. it's still pretty packed, but it was worse before.  sneaker collecting seems like a bit of a different animal.  so how does this compare? for me, what i do is completely different, or the way i view it is completely different and what i want from collecting is different than anyone that collects shoes or even a museum that collects fashion. my passion is for people to be wearing or using the clothes. the reason i do it is because i want it to be used. i m different in that way because my stuff is open for people to rent or use for shoots. i think it would be sad if the clothes didn t get used. even if it s, like, a bit of wear and tear. it doesn t matter because that s what keeps life in them. are any pieces deadstock? or have they all been worn, loaned, etc.? some stuff is, but i don t care to rip the tags off and use it. what am i going to do when i m 80 and have this perfectly preserved helmut lang piece with the tags on it? who cares? it would be much more interesting to say that i loaned this helmut lang piece to kanye and he s performed in it or it was in a vogue italia shoot and has a story. how does the loaning process work? is it mostly the stylists that contact you? i have to be a bit selective because i need to make sure the person loaned out to has an appreciation for the clothes and isn t going to ruin them. i don t sell them, so i have to make sure they aren t going to demand to keep it either. i have to be careful with who i loan to. because i work in fashion, i guess i already have connections in that way. i loan to big stylists and young, upcoming stylists. they re usually people who are friends or i know through friends and trust them. i like the idea of being able to support young talent or a young stylist and let them borrow the archive for the shoots because there isn t a lot of support for young stylists. as far as celebrities, i just have to make sure it s a celebrity that actually appreciates what i m doing. working with kanye, that opened doors to other young talent he s working with. i ve loaned to them and friends who style celebrities that i trust. i assume that kanye is the perfect sort of guy to loan to then, as he really enjoys learning about fashion. for kanye, his stylist was referred to me and she showed him some pictures i sent him and he actually came over to look at the whole thing which was pretty surreal. he was in heaven when he came over, which was a big compliment to me because he has seen so much. usually, it s a rapper or something they will think the pieces are cool, but kanye has a genuine interest in fashion and raf and helmut, so much so that he wanted to come over and see it all. that was pretty exciting. do you actually make money off of loaning the pieces out though? maybe one day i ll make money off it. i make some, but i ve bought way more than i ve made and i still want to keep buying more. so if i did make money, i would just use it to keep buying. it s not some business where i try to make tons of money off it. it s because i m passionate about raf and helmut and want a place to keep them all together and also love the idea of being able to have people use it as a resource. i wouldn t go so far to call it my way to cash in. my occupation as a stylist, goes along with that. how much would someone have to pay to rent a piece of yours? i guess i don t really want to give that out necessarily. but it always depends on the person, their budget, their relationship with me. it s not really a set thing. i just don t know if i want to say that for client protection and some pieces i would charge more for than others. is there any piece you really wanted to find that you got for a steal? or one that you were after for a while that you finally found? all the time. i would say it happens at least once a month because i do it consistently. if i just keep on it all the time, that piece i ve always wanted will come up. sometimes it will be cheap and sometimes it will be a lot. if it s a lot, then fine. i also get things for pretty cheap, so it evens out i guess. i just found a helmut lang nipple tank. there weren t many of those made. i was always looking for that. i found it once before and the seller wouldn t give it to me for some reason. but recently i found one so that was cool.  how about a super rare piece that you got for a steal? do some people not actually know what they have and you can fleece them? the way i put it is, people that sell raf are stupid because they re selling raf. you know what i mean? i assume they aren t the brightest. why would you sell raf? why wouldn t you keep it? this person is already stupid enough to be selling raf. that s how i look at it. in regards to raf and all the attention he's been getting recently, has that been good for business? yeah, definitely. i remember a few years ago, i felt like a lone raf fan in a sea of people. i used to work on his shows in paris when i lived in london. i d be telling my friends going with me and they d be like,  oh great  and they didn t understand. but with kanye and all that stuff, there is more of raf mania now. has there been another designer like that, who had that sort of popularity since you ve been collecting?  i feel like helmut has always been consistently known and amazing, but there isn t a helmut lang movie or anything. he's always been a bit underground, which is cool in a way. i mean old dior homme and saint laurent now i guess, but i don t collect that as much now since it s new. but hedi slimane stuff tends to get in the same category. what piece have you loaned out the most times? it s so funny, it s an l.l. bean sheer turtleneck. no joke, it s always loaned out. it's surprising. it always gets pulled. it s so random. it s from a few years ago. i got it for a shoot and just kept it and people kept using it. i guess because it s a basic piece that you can t find. then the bomber jackets too, people always pull those. are there any piece that you re currently on the hunt for? always, but i took a break this month because i got a new apartment and was buying furniture and focusing on that, so i zoned out a bit. i was looking for a helmut bondage bomber jacket, but i found it. that was big. but right now there s nothing in particular. do you think any current brands will reach the collectible level that, like, raf or helmut lang are now? yeah, i do. what i m collecting now is craig green because that s amazing. i d say that is the main new one i m after right now and i think it s going to be amazing. i love new young designers. not all of them, but a lot of them. my friend grace wales bonner, who's based in london, is making big waves and does menswear. for a deeper look into the world of david casavant, follow him on instagram and tumblr.         this tumblr image came across my attention earlier today. it supposes that kanye west's creative director, virgil abloh, whose recently-launched pyrex vision line sold out in a matter of minutes after becoming available, merely screenprinted a handful of ralph lauren rugby flannel shirts and re-sold them for a whopping $550. now, $550 for a flannel is pricey for most, but in the world of luxury, streetwear-oriented style in which pyrex is trying to compete, it's not unheard of. take for example the $355 givenchy tartan flannel kanye west sported during an occupy wall street appearance in 2011. much of the criticism towards abloh's new line is directed towards the price points versus materials used. while his tees are printed on champion blanks, it could easily be argued that givenchy's graphic tees and the filip pagowski-designed heart logo that pushes the price of any comme des garcons play basic up a couple of hundred dollars are equally overpriced. there's no arguing that often luxury goods get by more on brand cachet than craftsmanship. upon closer investigation of pyrex's $550 blue screenprinted flannel and rugby's country workshirt, which retailed for $79.95, but is currently on sale for $35.99 as the brand prepares to shutter forever, i am entirely convinced they are in fact the same shirt. it's highly possible pyrex simply bought a bunch of rugby flannels, slapped pyrex 23 on the back, and re-sold them for an astonishing markup of about 700%. for one, you simply can't buy rugby wholesale. it was a sub-brand that ralph lauren sold only in rugby stores. secondly, they are definitely made of the same fabric, but what seals the deal are the same construction details (triple-stitched construction at the arms, a pencil pocket on the left chest pocket) and the obvious photoshop job that shows remnants of an old rugby tag on the flannels. while the streetwear world has long played on the convention of flipping high-fashion imagery and re-contextualizing in a cultural cool context, abloh and company's hustle consists of a different sort of swagger jacking. with a limited run of shirts, and the nominal cost of screenprinting pyrex 23 on the back of each one, it's highly possible pyrex simply bought a bunch of rugby flannels, at retail no less, slapped pyrex 23 on the back and re-sold them for an astonishing markup of about 700%. should abloh be called out for blatantly ripping people off? or is this absurdity reflective of the current status of the hype game? yes, it's egregious that these rugby shirts became such a coveted streetwear item, but what's worse is that they sold out. people who pay attention to the goings-on around kanye west's crew know that much of abloh's current pursuits #been #trill and pyrex among them started off as inside jokes with other cool guy creatives like matthew williams, but what happens when consumers become the butt of it? is this act to be despised or congratulated? after all, as jay-z purported to sell ice in the winter and fire in hell, perhaps pyrex, and the fact that it's been seen on prominent, style-influential rappers like a$ap rocky and kanye west, goes to show that in the world of limited supply and instant demand hype springs eternal. update: rsvp gallery has since removed images of the sold out flannel shirt from their website. update ii: union is advertising their stock of pyrex flannels with the rugby ralph lauren tags intact. update iii: we reached out to union's chris gibbs for comment... when union la bought the flannels from pyrex, did you guys know they were rugby shirts?  no i was not aware of this.   if not, did the samples have the tags removed/photoshopped out, as they were on the pyrex and rsvp gallery sites? there is no way for me to have known that these were rugby blanks. i ordered them off of an excel file, so i couldn't see detail like that. that said, i have to admit i wasn't completely surprised or disappointed. i feel like i actually heard the news about the rugby blanks from the blogosphere while i was in paris. the goods had already arrived at the store, but i hadn't seen them yet. what i can say is this: now that the word is out, the customer can make an informed decision. for us we have a very liberal return policy so anyone that is unhappy can return the goods anyways... most lines have a following of people who appreciate the line holistically. these customers not only like the product, but they also like what the brand stands for, they like belonging to the community of a-alikes (like minded) individuals. the pyrex customer might not really care about rugby blanks...in fact they might like the whole 'fuck it' kind of 'by any means necessary' mentality and the 'lo' [polo] reference, of course. is union la now showing the rugby tags to keep the product's transparency 100% and keep faith in your store? we always strive to have 100% transparency... [gallery link=file order=desc columns=1]         you threw a punch at a homeless guy today. the air was cold and you sort of missed and it didn't hurt as much as you thought it was going to, but as your fist glanced off his collarbone you realized dude wasn't even trying to protect himself. you're not sure what it means, but it makes you feel good and you're not sure what that means either, but you took care of business. your breath steams into clouds in front of the coffee shop and you wonder why he called you a faggot. you were wearing og en noir sweats from a few seasons ago, the lambskin ones with the gold riris. you're not gay. you're cool with guys who are, but that's not you. these leathers cost a grip and when this bum, this leering, stinking, bottle-toting street creature piece of garbage, called you a fag, you put him in his place. after you punched him honestly, you softened the blow because you didn't want to hurt him really, just let him know you were on one he gurgled off down the sidewalk, wobbling from white chick to white chick looking for change. who's a fag, you say to no one. you talk about virgil all spring. you and your boys. he's like the boarding school friend who's never around, except for holiday weekends and rocky concerts when he comes through and he's in your city. you have plans to meet up, but it doesn't happen. it's cool. virgil is the homie. later, when #been #trill does a capsule with pacsun and everyone talks shit and calls him a sellout, you hold it down. so what if he sold out, you tweet. i'd do the same thing. a brand is a business and a business is about making money. you may not know much, but you know that. your parents love you and each other and you don't know what to do about it. in the middle of the night you wake up with a hard on and the first thing you do is scramble and snatch for your phone your twitter, your instagram, your snapchat. but your mentions are empty and she hasn't responded to the eggplant you dropped on that #tbt you deep liked. she knows it's a joke. it was a joke. in the corner of you room you spy a dusty pair of red wings. you wonder when was the last time you actually wore them. but you don't really care because americana is dead. beneath the comforter, your boner goes back to sleep and you soon follow. college was wack as fuck. you didn't learn shit. everyone was from suburbs like you, but they were fine with it. they were soft. you were different. asher roth's corny song dropped your sophomore year and people loved it even though it was corny. it was catchy and you loved it too, but if anyone asked you'd say it was an embarrassment to real hip-hop because you thought it might be. you remember playing tony hawk pro skater on n64 with your roommates even though you had an xbox, and drinking vodka from the bottle and dating two girls, one who was kinda weird and one who would have loved you if you cared. money over bitches, your away message read. that was before trukfit. none of it mattered anyway. it wasn't real. college was bullshit. you debate. you subtweet. you network. you slide into their girl's dms like. college is over and you are out here now. soon, you're launching a brand with your boys and it's fire. you're starting out with t-shirts, but they're screenprinted in l.a. by the same manufacturer that stampd uses, you heard. you're on your grind. the brand is called pvrgatory and sometimes when you're lying awake at night you practice pitching a collaboration to ferg. f3rgatory, maybe. a facebook push notification illuminates your room like the seawater around a jellyfish. then it's dark again. cruel summer. pyrex's summer. you're on a plane to l.a. and you snap a picture of the wing to tweet via yfrog, but you don't know if it's lame and you noticed people aren't using yfrog much any more. at a house party in silverlake everyone is drinking miller high life and wearing snapbacks and talking about grizzly bear. you talk to this girl about how fucking dope new york is, but she's about to be on a reality television show and keeps trying to change the subject to be about her. your friends are gone and you are faded. l.a. is soft. you look in the mirror and come to the harsh realization that you've seemingly had the exact same haircut your entire life. you make a mental note to tell your barber to go shorter on the sides next time. you're working on pvrgatory five panels now and a new website that speaks to the lifestyle. you've even got your own url. no more .bigcartel.com anymore. the brand is killing it. you've sold out of all your first run skus. you give an interview on nylon guys, but despite trying your hardest to seem #relevant and name-drop and push it hard on all your social media, nobody comments. you email the editor asking if anyone is reading it. he finally hits you back with a cryptic answer that more or less confirms your deepest fears. you go to the trade shows in nyc, but everyone says they're holding their good stuff for vegas and you want to go to vegas so you ask your parents to spot you and they do. you're ashamed about mooching so you tell yourself it's a business loan and fly to vegas, where you make out with a random pr chick at the 10.deep after-party. the bassline of all gold everything plods through your chest as you try to remember her name. you spend the last of your cash buying a lap dance from a light skin stripper with a fat ass at the spearmint rhino. in the airport you meet a buyer from zumiez and you pitch him on your shit so fucking cool he doesn't even know he's being pitched. so cool. you'll put in the work. you'll build. he loves it and hands you his card and you tuck it in your phone case like a feather in your cap. you never hear back from him, but you don't care because zumiez is basic and you tell everyone about the time that thirstball fuccboi chased you down in mccarran international. you fuck a basic from brooklyn and she jokes that she needs your help getting dressed and not the other way around. it's not a joke. 18 months later when you finally move off your phone's family plan, the card will flutter to the ground an ancient monument to your ambition, to a time when you had conversations about product with your name on it. your face burns in the sprint store and don't know why, but right now you are making moves  and closing deals  and you can't imagine what mediocrity feels like because you are it. as you swipe your credit card, you wonder if you can actually afford this new plan, but you run through data like it's nothing and, besides, you're not going to stop instagramming. you sell a bunch of grails on the forums to make rent. in the fall, everyone adds a$ap prefixes to their twitter handles. you're a$ap pvrg, but it's just a joke, and they know that. you're at the burton party in soho and the homies are there and travi$ scott is supposed to perform, but fashion's night out is crazy and he never makes it. you eat free meatball shop meatballs and snap photos of rare collaborations for something. your tumblr maybe? you're not sure yet. you're tired and you want to go home, but instead you pop molly in a cab full of girls headed to westway, where you sweat until daybreak. tomorrow afternoon you'll wake up crying, but that shit won't bother you because it's just the drugs. you stay super late at the ace hotel even though it's a weekday night, pounding tecate cans with salt and lime wedges because that's how you're supposed to drink them. you're hammered and the n-word slips out in front of your black friend while reciting the chorus of this banger you just saw on worldstar. he lets it slide because you are boys and you send a tweet to your drafts about how you just got your hood pass. you puke all over the lobby at 4am and get kicked out and probably banned from the ace for life. but you don't really care because americana is dead. you pop a 'gram of your sick new flyknit racers. #bae, reads the caption. it hits 11 likes in under two minutes and 100 by the end of the afternoon and it feels good. they ask me who i am and who i do it for, you whisper to no one. you wonder if nardwuar gets laid more than you. when your credit card gets declined at 21 mercer you nonchalantly whip out another one because you're wearing dsm exclusives and the checkout girl has great style. must be all the bottles, you say. it's a joke and she knows it's a joke. you walk out slow so she sees your kicks and later when you come back you wear a gyakusou vest to really seal the deal but she's not working that day. you never see her again. you fuck a basic from brooklyn and she jokes that she needs your help getting dressed and not the other way around. it's not a joke. you are sitting in atrium explaining joggers to her when you realize you hate her so you make up an excuse and skip out after a quick goodbye. you never see her again. you instagram your yeezus tour tickets and it's the most likes you ve ever gotten. so #blessed, reads the caption. you don't remember the concert. you don't even remember if you went. you write a thinkpiece for free about confederate flags and people respond. your stats bob up chartbeat like a helium balloon, then sink back down like waterlogged driftwood. you hit up your editor about filing some more darts, except you want to be paid moving forward. your #content speaks for itself. you don't think about pvrgatory much anymore. your boys all have linkedin profiles now and you don't have the time for that, or for them. you still pay $10.99 a month for the url, because you'll start it back up and get it going eventually. every once in a while a customer emails you asking why they never got the hat they ordered. the credit card company used to email you, but now they've started calling and they're calling now. in the glare of your phone screen you read unknown number and bite down hard on the inside of your cheek and hit ignore. you can't ignore your parents though. they ask you gently, offhandedly about the vegas money and you tell them you'll write them a check soon, but you don't have any checks and, besides, if they'd just signed up for paypal like you told them to, you wouldn't have to write them a check to begin with. you stop worrying about it and get drunk at a launch event for some stupid fucking brand and when the pr girl offers you coke you laugh because who does she think she's talking to, bruh. you head to the bathroom to do a line with her and the shit is bad, but she starts making out with you and touches your dick over your public school jeans and you go along with it because even though she's a butterface she has perfect ombre hair. she won't smash there and you don't feel like waiting around to meet her after the event and you can't get hard when you're on coke anyway so you leave. you smoke a marlboro red you bummed earlier in the night and cough up a lung. it me, you tweet to no one. your boy bails on the soulcycle class you two signed up for because he's the only person you know more selfish you. you go to the class anyway because you've got on your next level meggings and haven't even broken them out yet. you're surprised at how quickly the time passes as long as you imagine the conversations you'd have with the sexy asian in the front row who's wearing nothing but a sports bra. as you leave, you spot her wearing celine slip-ons. you get a cold-pressed green juice for lunch and debate whether or not this is what falling in love feels like. twitter's shiny new layout shows favorites and retweets, unblinking zeroes. you have a job interview tomorrow, but you give zero fucks, so you're walking down broadway at 3am hitting a g pen you got for free and thinking about that girl from 21 mercer, the one who never saw your gyakusou vest because she wasn't there. when you realize that was almost two years ago, you shiver involuntarily and look up. broadway seems wider than it used to. from curb to curb there's a mile of inky black asphalt, yawning like the interminable canyon between heaven and hell and you're afraid to fall in. you wonder if that basic chick ever shopped at atrium again. you wonder if that zumiez rep even knows what htm stands for. you wonder what your roommates from college are up to. you wonder if anyone else realizes that americana is dead. your breath steams into clouds in front of the do not walk sign, and after a few minutes of wondering what you stand for, it's clear you've already fallen. dave infante is a writer living in new york city. he's totally fine, you guys. seriously, don't worry about him. read more of his work on thrillist and follow him on twitter while he's still breathing.         i wanted to like shinola. i wanted to so badly. a detroit design firm manufacturing products in the united states that's not another car company? i was ready to ride or die. but, like anything in this world that sounds too good to be true, shinola's press kit is full of asterisks:  shinola isn't really a detroit company. bedrock brands owns shinola. there is no website for bedrock, but the privately held conglomerate was created by the co-founder of fossil watches, and owns other brands like filson. it is based in texas. the watches aren t manufactured in detroit, but they are assembled here from parts made overseas from their partner, swiss-based watch manufacturer ronda ag. the bikes aren't manufactured in detroit either. again, they are assembled here with parts made elsewhere. although the frames are welded in wisconsin. all of these asterisks wouldn't be necessary except that shinola's entire presence is predicated on its ties to the city of detroit. the justification for the cheapest men's watch being $550? for bicycles that cost a minimum of $1,950? american manufacturing costs more. quality materials cost more. american products are inherently worth more. like buying a pair of toms helps some poor third world kid, by buying a two thousand dollar bike you're doing your part to help rebuild a fallen american city. in this way, shinola reminds us what the american dream actually is: a selling point, nothing more than a sales pitch. to paint this rockwellian picture shinola has spared no expense. they brought in sky yaeger, the designer of bianchi's pista model, among others, to design their bikes. they spent $14.5 million on their nyc tribeca flagship. (i wonder how much they invested in the real estate they occupy in detroit? the details of the company's agreement to lease 30,000 square feet in the old gm argonaut building have not been released.) they have filled out their retail stores with products from hickoree's, steven alan, archival clothing and common projects. they even hired bruce weber for an ad campaign. instead of starting in his parent s garage, shinola is a trust fund kid that decided one day he wanted to start a company and had his dad buy him all the cool stuff. and much to my chagrin, all this money seems to paying off. shinola's roster of stockists is impressive. their initial offering of watches sold out before they were even assembled. shinola is using my city as its shill, pushing a manufactured, outdated and unrealistic ideal of america. the most irksome thing about shinola and its opportunistic promotional campaign? while they've mastered opportunistic marketing, they get the most important aspects of being a design firm all wrong. see, the products just aren't that great. the brand sells denim produced by a detroit company. again, on its surface, not such a bad move. yet, in an interview on their blog, the owner of the detroit denim co. (and shinola by proxy) perpetuates selling points about selvedge denim that are simply not true. the selvedge aspect of denim does not make it wear better. it's not inherently better than non-selvedge denim. they say not to wash your jeans. going so far as to suggest putting your jeans in a freezer and washing them in the ocean or even in vinegar, all of which is complete bullshit and if you don t believe me check out this video where denim lords andrew chen and kiya babzani completely ether these myths in less than three minutes. the watches? as the new york times' jon caramanica aptly put it, the watches  [suggest] timepieces of six decades ago, or public school wall clocks. they are made with quartz movements, which in and of itself isn't a bad thing, especially when attempting to build a watch manufacturing company from the ground up. but shinola's emphasis is supposedly on quality, on craftsmanship, on unique goods handmade by hardworking american hands. most mechanical movements are unique and proprietary. they are marvels of craftsmanship that seem to embody the mechanical prowess shinola attempts to glom onto by positioning itself inside the former general motors design laboratory. currently, i doubt american manufacturing is capable of crafting mechanical movements. in that way, shinola's watches belie the notion that american manufacturing is simply better than the rest of the world's. granted, a mechanical movement would significantly raise the price of shinola s watches, but when you're introducing $2,000 bikes and simultaneously offering $5,000 rolexes and vintage american flags that range in price from fifteen to fifty thousand dollars, price can't really be that much of an issue, can it? the thought of a company selling such luxuriously priced goods in a city that, according to the 2010 census, has a per capita income of $14,000 is downright laughable. even their social media campaign are insulting: for every #saynicethings post on social media, we will write those intentions on paper embedded with seeds. the seed paper will later be planted throughout detroit, specifically for use in the beautification of a dog park near our detroit store. this is shinola's say something nice campaign. a take on a '70s movement designed to combat the negative press detroit was generating. this pollyanna outlook on detroit simply glosses over details about the city that don't conveniently fit shinola s narrative. listen, i can stomach hipsters planting flowers written with nice things about detroit for a dog park one day. i can take $500 quartz watches and a section on their webshop entitled curated that offers american flags that cost more than a brand new car. i can even take ten dollar cold-pressed juices when the city lacks grocery stores. even those aren't too much of an affront. what i can't take is the white knighting of shinola's promotional campaigns. the company insists that detroit isn t as bad as it seems that there are happy and proud people here too. to demonstrate just how optimistic and amazing detroiters are, shinola enlisted bruce weber and carolyn murphy both out of towners, both white to shoot the company s latest ad campaign. the accompanying video, subtitled a snapshot of life in the motor city, features photogenic models pedaling two thousand dollar bikes through the city. photos of adorable black kids with a beautiful, benevolent white woman seem to be the centerpiece of weber's campaign for the company. they even have a video of one of the little girls rapping. bruce weber is quoted saying, people were really friendly. they looked you in the eye when they said hello on the street, and they greeted you with a smile. detroit may be bankrupt, but that doesn't mean its citizens aren't normal, functioning human beings, bruce. this idea that people would be surprised by how human and artistic and talented detroit's citizens are if they just came and visited is ludicrous and emblematic of a new type of gentrification, one that seems even more insidious than what has occurred in, say, brooklyn. shinola and other entrepreneurs market themselves as white knights, swooping in to save the noble savages. they help assuage the guilt associated with gentrification and consumerism by pointing out how strong and proud and culturally important the natives truly are that simply by choosing to be in detroit, shinola is somehow better than other companies selling similar products. shinola is using my city as its shill, pushing a manufactured, outdated and unrealistic ideal of america. and, in that way, the company s slogan where american is made is more accurate than its owners could have ever hoped.         #menswear loves girls in menswear, rarely women; certainly never large women displaying any sign of strength. outside of navy knit ties and nick wooster s short suits, #menswear reserves a particular taste for skinny ing nues turned languidly away from the camera in ocbds. often reblogged piecemeal thigh gap legs in new balance s, bony shoulders holding up bathing ape photos of these girls circulate with questions of appropriateness shrugged off. shared without any information about the model, bloggers are free to assume she just looks young or maybe has one of those mythically fast metabolisms. which is always possible, but ignores the problems raised by cultish worship of the youngest ages and narrowest waists. the insecurity this idolatry breeds in women is well documented, but female insecurities are nothing if not a reaction to the externalization of male insecurities. like boy bands crooning  you look pretty when you cry,  the penchant for slight figures is a reminder that vulnerability absurdly, persistently codes for  feminine,  exclusively to serve as a foil for men, whose competence can emerge relative to the delicacy celebrated in women. men who pride themselves on their sophistication keep swooning over body types that blur the line between childlike and child. there are, thankfully, exceptions to the ubiquity of pedowave on menwear blogs. plenty would rather post well-dressed adults they view as equals. but for every adrianne ho, an unidentified gamin bounces from dashboard to dashboard. between photos of handmade wallets and silk umbrellas, creepshots pass as stylishly demure. in real life, collarbone shadows do not hint at weakness and eye size is not proportional to innocence. reblogging pictures of teens and captioning them  wifey  aligns attractiveness with all the baggage of skinny youth: vulnerability and innocence. in contrast to the child models of the past, these girls aren t makeup-ed into maturity. the contemporary enthusiasm for the  natural look  soothes male anxieties about the trickery of women s choices, while pretending to be a preference for the  authentic . demanding  not too much makeup  is a lifehack against women presenting themselves to you on their own terms rather than yours. and what figure offers the most iconic imagery of pretty women availing themselves to a man s whims than the waif, floating doe eyed after the boring protagonist? tumblr s collective crush on heroines like odile from bande   part underpins certain menswear bloggers ever-hopeful search for a waify to wife. they mistake small figures for a small personality. in real life, collarbone shadows do not hint at weakness and eye size is not proportional to innocence. physically speaking, i identify with these young looking, perpetually thin girls in oversized sweaters and men s shirts, which makes the aestheticization of female vulnerability so sinister. when attractiveness is codified along a gendered division of power i cannot trust a man only attracted to women who look like they need him. ayesha a. siddiqi is a writer based in the south. you can follow her on twitter here and read more of her writing here.         it's safe to say that too much ink has been spilled covering the cultural phenomenon known as #menswear. from unnecessarily high-brow fuckery to an ironic book that shall remain nameless because it was written by very same guy who cuts my checks, #menswear has grabbed the attention of dudes across the internetz through the omnipotent power of social media. while mainstream america is finally catching on to the benefits of tailored clothing and well-designed footwear, for us die-hard dork types, #menswear s rise paralleled the rise of tumblr-based blogging and twitter-based ranting circa late 2008 up until now. because #menswear gave way to the general acceptance of a certain desire to look good, it in turn afforded a whole new level of creativity from a handful of ambitious and emerging brands and designers. if we really want to understand #menswear at face value, our best bet is to observe and quantify those under its loosely defined umbrella. let's just get it out of the way and say that any discussion of #menswear is, at best, dogma and, at worst, conversational masturbation. however, we the best, so fuck it. above, we honor those that paved the way for a generation of sartorially inclined gentleman and helped propel an often change resistant industry. jake woolf is a writer living in new york city. you can read his blog here and follow him on twitter here.         i write articles about all sorts of issues, from relationships to movies to life. people often say, why don t you guys keep your articles to menswear, or this isn t bad, but menswear is better, or if you slit your wrists, nobody would go to your

article about menswear. it's a fashion article from my point of view the real questions i've been pondering and been too afraid to ask. so hold onto your ascots, shit's about to get really real i.e.

more specifically than, like, chicks wearing faded mom jeans, billy was onto some shit that you might actually see your favorite editor rocking tomorrow. the volume of sports-related garments billy and co. rock is telling too. he's 28, but back in elementary school in the '90s. most of the white dudes writing on this site about trendy sports-inspired gear are in their mid-20s and went to elementary school in the '90s. both the movie, and the recent trends in menswear, are sentimental. but so is burning bags of shit on old people's porches, so let's not overthink it. angelo spagnolo is a writer living in portland, oregon. read his blog here and follow him on twitter here.         ah yes, the mythical douchebag. once an easily defined species, the douchebag has evolved throughout time and space to now represents a multitude of shapes, sizes, behaviors and, of course, wardrobes. the epic rise of the internet has only exacerbated this fact the enormous influx of information shared has made the douchebag more clever than ever before. as this sect of assholes matured, so did their clothing choices. items once regarded as classic staples have been unprecedentedly co-opted and bastardized, becoming symbols synonymous with ostentatious tackiness right before our very eyes. and that's exactly why we've outlined the 50 most recognizable garments in the history of douchedom, so that you are better equipped to identify, avoid and, ultimately, protect yourself against their socially corrosive ways. godspeed.         when you're in the business of dudes wearing clothes on the internet, nostalgia is a currency you trade heavily in. from pretending our dads were cool, to idolizing a bunch of dead racists, to quoting rappers who rap raps about cartoons and cereal, the past is something we hold dear. so, we're finna take things back, way back. like, before subway toasted their subs back. let's travel in our digital delorean to a time when we were just kids. a time when anything was possible. a time before we cared about clothes, but still-kinda-actually cared about clothes. a time when we didn't get dressed for twitter, tumblr, instagram, blogs or street style. we weren't jaded and we didn't know what the fuck a four-in-hand knot was. we were just figuring it all out and it was a beautiful thing. these are the 50 greatest brands of our youth.
